              other domains. This paper is a survey of the literature to date,

                   have attained superhuman performance in a number of
                   challenging task domains. However, a major limitation of
                   such applications is their demand for massive amounts of
                   training data. A critical present objective is thus to
                   develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks.
                   In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this
                   challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement
                   learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks
                   can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We
                   extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a
                   system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose
                   recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL
                   procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from
                   the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it
                   is learned, it is configured to exploit structure in the
                   training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven
                   proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key
                   aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending
                   and scaling up the approach, and also point out some
                   potentially important implications for neuroscience.",

               state and goal, and then learning a mapping from s and g to

               be incorporated into a reinforcement learning algorithm that
               updates the UVFA solely from observed rewards. Finally, we

                   classes may be tied together through logical constraints.
                   For example, a set of classes may be mutually exclusive,
                   meaning that a data instance can belong to at most one of
                   them. The proposed method is based on the intuition that:
                   (i) when classifiers agree, they are more likely to be
                   correct, and (ii) when the classifiers make a prediction

               large and often complex datasets. Evidence is collected,
               collated and cross-linked with our existing knowledge. In the
               process, a myriad of analytical and visualisation techniques are
               employed to generate a visual representation of the data. These
               often introduce their own uncertainties, in addition to the ones
               inherent in the data, and these propagated and compounded
               uncertainties can result in impaired decision making. The user's
               confidence or trust in the results depends on the extent of
               user's awareness of the underlying uncertainties generated on
               the system side. This paper unpacks the uncertainties that
               propagate through visual analytics systems, illustrates how
               human's perceptual and cognitive biases influence the user's
               awareness of such uncertainties, and how this affects the user's
               trust building. The knowledge generation model for visual

  abstract   = "Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied
                machine learning. However such tools for regression and
                classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison,
                Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to
                reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a
                prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new
                theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural
                networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep
                Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us
                tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting
                information from existing models that has been thrown away so
                far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in
                deep learning without sacrificing either computational
                complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of
                the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network

                   to be learned automatically for autonomous robotic
                   platforms. However, practical deployment of reinforcement
                   learning methods must contend with the fact that the
                   training process itself can be unsafe for the robot. In this
                   paper, we consider the specific case of a mobile robot
                   learning to navigate an a priori unknown environment while
                   avoiding collisions. In order to learn collision avoidance,
                   the robot must experience collisions at training time.
                   However, high-speed collisions, even at training time, could
                   damage the robot. A successful learning method must
                   therefore proceed cautiously, experiencing only low-speed
                   collisions until it gains confidence. To this end, we
                   present an uncertainty-aware model-based learning algorithm
                   that estimates the probability of collision together with a
                   statistical estimate of uncertainty. By formulating an
                   uncertainty-dependent cost function, we show that the
                   algorithm naturally chooses to proceed cautiously in
                   unfamiliar environments, and increases the velocity of the
                   robot in settings where it has high confidence. Our
                   predictive model is based on bootstrapped neural networks

                   correctly anticipate a robot's behavior in novel situations.
                   This behavior is often a direct result of the robot's
                   underlying objective function. Our insight is that end-users
                   need to have an accurate mental model of this objective
                   function in order to understand and predict what the robot
                   will do. While people naturally develop such a mental model
                   over time through observing the robot act, this
                   familiarization process may be lengthy. Our approach reduces
                   this time by having the robot model how people infer
                   objectives from observed behavior, and then selecting those
                   behaviors that are maximally informative. The problem of
                   computing a posterior over objectives from observed behavior
                   is known as Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and has
                   been applied to robots learning human objectives. We
                   consider the problem where the roles of human and robot are
                   swapped. Our main contribution is to recognize that unlike
                   robots, humans will not be \textbackslashemph\{exact\} in
                   their IRL inference. We thus introduce two factors to define

                   example behaviors that better enable users to anticipate
                   what the robot will do in test situations. Our results also

  abstract  = "Robots inevitably fail, often without the ability to recover
               autonomously. We demonstrate an approach for enabling a robot to
               recover from failures by communicating its need for specific
               help to a human partner using natural language. Our approach
               automatically detects failures, then generates targeted
               spoken-language requests for help such as ```Please give me the
               white table leg that is on the black table.'' Once the human
               partner has repaired the failure condition, the system resumes
               full autonomy. We present a novel inverse semantics algorithm
               for generating effective help requests. In contrast to forward
               semantic models that interpret natural language in terms of
               robot actions and perception, our inverse semantics algorithm
               generates requests by emulating the human's ability to interpret
               a request using the Generalized Grounding Graph (G³) framework.
               To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we present a
               corpus-based online evaluation, as well as an end-to-end user
               study, demonstrating that our approach increases the

               of a human-robot team as part of an adjustable autonomy system.
               The effectiveness measure is aimed at determining an appropriate
               autonomy level prior to the system's deployment. Two competing
               goals need to be traded off: maximising robot performance while
               minimising the amount of human input. The relative importance of
               the two goals depend on the mission priorities and constraints
               which are taken into account. The proposed methodology is
               applied to a human-robot communication system developed for
               task- oriented information exchange. The robot uses a decision-
               theoretic framework to act autonomously and to decide when to
               request input from human operators. The latter is achieved by
               computing the value-of-information an operator is able to
               provide which is compared to the cost of obtaining the
               information. For our system, the cost parameter represents the
               autonomy level to be determined. We demonstrate how an
               appropriate autonomy level can be found experimentally using a
               navigation task. In our experiment, the robot navigates through
               a set of simulated worlds with human input being generated by a
               software component. The results are used to find appropriate

                   predictive models of human motion. Unfortunately, these
                   models cannot capture the full complexity of human behavior
                   and necessarily introduce simplifying assumptions. As a
                   result, predictions may degrade whenever the observed human
                   behavior departs from the assumed structure, which can have
                   negative implications for safety. In this paper, we observe
                   that how ``rational'' human actions appear under a
                   particular model can be viewed as an indicator of that

               computational perspective, covering both theory and applications
               ranging from speech recognition to airborne collision

               uncertainty---that is, choosing actions based on often imperfect
               observations, with unknown outcomes. Designers of automated
               decision support systems must take into account the various
               sources of uncertainty while balancing the multiple objectives
               of the system. This book provides an introduction to the
               challenges of decision making under uncertainty from a
               computational perspective. It presents both the theory behind
               decision making models and algorithms and a collection of
               example applications that range from speech recognition to
               aircraft collision avoidance.Focusing on two methods for
               designing decision agents, planning and reinforcement learning,
               the book covers probabilistic models, introducing Bayesian
               networks as a graphical model that captures probabilistic
               relationships between variables; utility theory as a framework
               for understanding optimal decision making under uncertainty;
               Markov decision processes as a method for modeling sequential
               problems; model uncertainty; state uncertainty; and cooperative
               decision making involving multiple interacting agents. A series
               of applications shows how the theoretical concepts can be
               applied to systems for attribute-based person search, speech
               applications, collision avoidance, and unmanned aircraft
               persistent surveillance.Decision Making Under Uncertainty
               unifies research from different communities using consistent

               modules and end-to-end controllers for self-driving cars, this
               raises concerns about their safety. We develop a novel automated
               verification framework for feed-forward multi-layer neural
               networks based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). We focus
               on safety of image classification decisions with respect to

               angle or lighting conditions that would result in the same class

               decision in terms of invariance of the classification within a
               small neighbourhood of the original image. We enable exhaustive
               search of the region by employing discretisation, and propagate
               the analysis layer by layer. Our method works directly with the

               that adversarial examples, if they exist, are found for the

               examples can be shown to human testers and/or used to fine-tune

               as measured by a stochastic objective function evaluated on
               simulated combat engagements. Gaussian process Bayesian
               optimization techniques are developed to automatically learn
               global Gaussian process surrogate models, which provide
               statistical performance predictions in both explored and
               unexplored areas of the parameter space. This allows a learning
               engine to sample full-combat simulations at parameter values
               that are most likely to optimize performance and provide highly
               informative data points for improving future predictions.
               However, standard Gaussian process Bayesian optimization methods
               do not provide a reliable surrogate model for the highly
               volatile objective functions found in aerial combat and thus do
               not reliably identify global maxima. These issues are addressed
               by novel repeat sampling and hybrid repeat/multipoint sampling
               techniques. Simulation studies show that hybrid
               repeat/multipoint sampling improves the accuracy of Gaussian
               process surrogate models, allowing artificial-intelligence

  author   = "de Visser, Ewart J and Pak, Richard and Shaw, Tyler H",
  abstract = "Modern interactions with technology are increasingly moving away
              from simple human use of computers as tools to the establishment
              of human relationships with autonomous entities that carry out
              actions on our behalf. In a recent commentary, Peter Hancock
              (Hancock, 2017) issued a stark warning to the field of human
              factors that attention must be focused on the appropriate design
              of a new class of technology: highly autonomous systems. In this
              article, we heed the warning and propose a human-centered
              approach directly aimed at ensuring that future human-autonomy
              interactions remain focused on the user's needs and preferences.
              By adapting literature from industrial psychology, we propose a
              framework to infuse a unique human-like ability, building and
              actively repairing trust, into autonomous systems. We conclude by
              proposing a model to guide the design of future autonomy and a
              research agenda to explore current challenges in repairing trust
              between humans and autonomous systems. practitioner summary This
              paper is a call to practitioners to re-cast our connection to
              technology as akin to a relationship between two humans rather
              than between a human and their tools. To that end, designing
              autonomy with trust repair abilities will ensure future

  abstract = "According to standard procedure, building a classifier using
              machine learning is a fully automated process that follows the
              preparation of training data by a domain expert. In contrast,
              interactive machine learning engages users in actually generating
              the classifier themselves. This offers a natural way of
              integrating background knowledge into the modelling stage---as
              long as interactive tools can be designed that support efficient
              and effective communication. This paper shows that appropriate
              techniques can empower users to create models that compete with
              classifiers built by state-of-the-art learning algorithms. It
              demonstrates that users---even users who are not domain
              experts---can often construct good classifiers, without any help
              from a learning algorithm, using a simple two-dimensional visual
              interface. Experiments on real data demonstrate that, not
              surprisingly, success hinges on the domain: if a few attributes
              can support good predictions, users generate accurate
              classifiers, whereas domains with many high-order attribute
              interactions favour standard machine learning techniques. We also
              present an artificial example where domain knowledge allows an
              ``expert user'' to create a much more accurate model than
              automatic learning algorithms. These results indicate that our
              system has the potential to produce highly accurate classifiers
              in the hands of a domain expert who has a strong interest in the
              domain and therefore some insights into how to partition the
              data. Moreover, small expert-defined models offer the additional
              advantage that they will generally be more intelligible than

                   deep neural networks (DNNs), including notable successes in
                   training convolutional neural networks (convnets) to
                   recognize natural images. However, our understanding of how
                   these models work, especially what computations they perform
                   at intermediate layers, has lagged behind. Progress in the
                   field will be further accelerated by the development of
                   better tools for visualizing and interpreting neural nets.
                   We introduce two such tools here. The first is a tool that
                   visualizes the activations produced on each layer of a
                   trained convnet as it processes an image or video (e.g. a
                   live webcam stream). We have found that looking at live
                   activations that change in response to user input helps
                   build valuable intuitions about how convnets work. The
                   second tool enables visualizing features at each layer of a
                   DNN via regularized optimization in image space. Because
                   previous versions of this idea produced less recognizable
                   images, here we introduce several new regularization methods
                   that combine to produce qualitatively clearer, more
                   interpretable visualizations. Both tools are open source and

              novel and highly flexible learning- based assistant selection
              framework that uses contextual multi- arm bandit algorithms. The

                   exhibit continuous function approximator capabilities.
                   Stochastic models allow direct specification of a model with
                   known interaction between parameters to generate data.
                   During the prediction phase, stochastic models generate a
                   complete posterior distribution and produce probabilistic
                   guarantees on the predictions. Thus BNNs are a unique
                   combination of neural network and stochastic models with the
                   stochastic model forming the core of this integration. BNNs
                   can then produce probabilistic guarantees on it's
                   predictions and also generate the distribution of parameters
                   that it has learnt from the observations. That means, in the
                   parameter space, one can deduce the nature and shape of the
                   neural network's learnt parameters. These two
                   characteristics makes them highly attractive to
                   theoreticians as well as practitioners. Recently there has
                   been a lot of activity in this area, with the advent of
                   numerous probabilistic programming libraries such as: PyMC3,
                   Edward, Stan etc. Further this area is rapidly gaining
                   ground as a standard machine learning approach for numerous

               What they don't know is how hard it is for us to design a reward
               function that actually captures what we want. When designing the
               reward, we might think of some specific training scenarios, and
               make sure that the reward will lead to the right behavior in
               those scenarios. Inevitably, agents encounter new scenarios
               (e.g., new types of terrain) where optimizing that same reward
               may lead to undesired behavior. Our insight is that reward
               functions are merely observations about what the designer
               actually wants, and that they should be interpreted in the
               context in which they were designed. We introduce inverse reward
               design (IRD) as the problem of inferring the true objective
               based on the designed reward and the training MDP. We introduce
               approximate methods for solving IRD problems, and use their
               solution to plan risk-averse behavior in test MDPs. Empirical
               results suggest that this approach can help alleviate negative
               side effects of misspecified reward functions and mitigate
               reward hacking.",

              measurements is motivated by their ability to capture a human's

                   perform correctly, understand the reasons behind their
                   actions, and know how to use them appropriately. In short:
                   they want to be able to trust such systems. Consequently,
                   designers have devised various kinds of assurances for
                   assessing trust. Typically, however, these assessments are
                   ad hoc, and have not been formally related to each other or
                   to formal trust models. This paper presents a survey of
                   algorithmic assurances that allow users to calibrate their
                   trust in autonomous artificially intelligent agents and use
                   such autonomous agents more appropriately. To this end
                   algorithmic assurances are first formally defined, and
                   classified, from the perspective of formally modeled trust
                   relationships. The survey is then performed using research

                   improving the effectiveness of data science models in

               the identification of lower dimensional subspaces. Principal
               component analysis is a dimension reduction technique that
               identifies linear combinations of variables along which most
               variation occurs or which best ?reconstruct? the original
               variables. For example, many temperature readings may be taken
               in a production process when in fact there are just a few
               underlying variables driving the process. A problem with
               principal components is that the linear combinations can seem
               quite arbitrary. To make them more interpretable, we introduce
               two classes of constraints. In the first, coefficients are
               constrained to equal a small number of values (homogeneity
               constraint). The second constraint attempts to set as many
               coefficients to zero as possible (sparsity constraint). The
               resultant interpretable directions are either calculated to be
               close to the original principal component directions, or
               calculated in a stepwise manner that may make the components
               more orthogonal. A small dataset on characteristics of cars is
               used to introduce the techniques. A more substantial data mining

  abstract = "Humans can meaningfully rate their confidence in a perceptual or
              cognitive decision. It is widely believed that these reports
              reflect the estimated probability that the decision is correct,
              but, upon closer look, this belief is a hypothesis rather than an
              established fact. In a pair of perceptual categorization tasks,
              we tested whether explicit confidence reports reflect the
              Bayesian posterior probability of being correct. This Bayesian
              hypothesis predicts that subjects take sensory uncertainty into
              account in a specific way in the computation of confidence
              ratings. We find that confidence reports are probabilistic:
              subjects take sensory uncertainty into account on a
              trial-to-trial basis. However, they do not do so in the way
              predicted by the Bayesian hypothesis. Instead, heuristic
              probabilistic models provide the best fit to human confidence
              ratings. This conclusion is robust to changes in the uncertainty
              manipulation, task, response modality, additional flexibility in
              the Bayesian model, and model comparison metric. To better
              understand the origins of the heuristic computation, we trained
              feedforward neural networks consisting of generic units with
              error feedback, mapped the output of the trained networks to
              confidence ratings, and fitted our behavioral models to the
              resulting synthetic datasets. We find that the synthetic
              confidence ratings are also best fit by heuristic probabilistic
              models. This suggests that implementational constraints cause
              explicit confidence reports to deviate from being Bayesian.",

              information processing in complex networks. Intuition is
              manifested in categorization based on evaluation of similarity,
              when decision borders are too complex to be reduced to logical

              mathematical framework comprised of two components: a mean
              function harnessing the predictive power of multiple independent
              variables, and a covariance function yielding spatio-temporal

                   does not scale to high dimensional state/action spaces. In
                   this paper, we introduce a new model learning procedure in
                   Black-DROPS that leverages parameterized black-box priors to
                   (1) scale up to high-dimensional systems, and (2) be robust
                   to large inaccuracies of the prior information. We
                   demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with the
                   ``pendubot'' swing-up task in simulation and with a physical
                   hexapod robot (48D state space, 18D action space) that has
                   to walk forward as fast as possible. The results show that
                   our new algorithm is more data-efficient than previous
                   model-based policy search algorithms (with and without
                   priors) and that it can allow a physical 6-legged robot to
                   learn new gaits in only 16 to 30 seconds of interaction

                   (beliefs, intents, knowledge, perspectives, etc.) to others
                   and recognize that these mental states may differ from one's
                   own. Theory of Mind is critical to effective communication
                   and to teams demonstrating higher collective performance. To
                   effectively leverage the progress in Artificial Intelligence
                   (AI) to make our lives more productive, it is important for
                   humans and AI to work well together in a team.
                   Traditionally, there has been much emphasis on research to
                   make AI more accurate, and (to a lesser extent) on having it
                   better understand human intentions, tendencies, beliefs, and
                   contexts. The latter involves making AI more human-like and
                   having it develop a theory of our minds. In this work, we
                   argue that for human-AI teams to be effective, humans must
                   also develop a theory of AI's mind - get to know its
                   strengths, weaknesses, beliefs, and quirks. We instantiate
                   these ideas within the domain of Visual Question Answering
                   (VQA). We find that using just a few examples(50), lay
                   people can be trained to better predict responses and
                   oncoming failures of a complex VQA model. Surprisingly, we
                   find that having access to the model's internal states - its
                   confidence in its top-k predictions, explicit or implicit
                   attention maps which highlight regions in the image (and
                   words in the question) the model is looking at (and
                   listening to) while answering a question about an image - do

                   to hardware and control to make robots fit to work with

                   practitioners seek to provide more transparency to their
                   algorithms. Much of this research is focused on explicitly
                   explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it
                   should not be controversial to say that, if these techniques
                   are to succeed, the explanations they generate should have a

                   that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses

              and interact with us in all parts of our daily lives. Therefore,
              just as we consider the safety of power plants, highways, and a
              variety of other engineered socio-technical systems, we must also
              take into account the safety of systems involving machine
              learning. Heretofore, the definition of safety has not been
              formalized in a machine learning context. In this paper, we do so
              by defining machine learning safety in terms of risk, epistemic
              uncertainty, and the harm incurred by unwanted outcomes. We then
              use this definition to examine safety in all sorts of
              applications in cyber-physical systems, decision sciences, and
              data products. We find that the foundational principle of modern
              statistical machine learning, empirical risk minimization, is not

              and Prediction",
  author   = "Lakkaraju, Himabindu and Bach, Stephen H and Jure, Leskovec",
  abstract = "One of the most important obstacles to deploying predictive
              models is the fact that humans do not understand and trust them.
              Knowing which variables are important in a model's prediction and
              how they are combined can be very powerful in helping people
              understand and trust automatic decision making systems. Here we
              propose interpretable decision sets, a framework for building
              predictive models that are highly accurate, yet also highly
              interpretable. Decision sets are sets of independent if-then
              rules. Because each rule can be applied independently, decision
              sets are simple, concise, and easily interpretable. We formalize
              decision set learning through an objective function that
              simultaneously optimizes accuracy and interpretability of the
              rules. In particular, our approach learns short, accurate, and
              non-overlapping rules that cover the whole feature space and pay
              attention to small but important classes. Moreover, we prove that
              our objective is a non-monotone submodular function, which we
              efficiently optimize to find a near-optimal set of rules.
              Experiments show that interpretable decision sets are as accurate
              at classification as state-of-the-art machine learning
              techniques. They are also three times smaller on average than
              rule-based models learned by other methods. Finally, results of a
              user study show that people are able to answer multiple-choice
              questions about the decision boundaries of interpretable decision
              sets and write descriptions of classes based on them faster and
              more accurately than with other rule-based models that were
              designed for interpretability. Overall, our framework provides a
              new approach to interpretable machine learning that balances
              accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.",

  abstract      = "Active learning has long been a topic of study in machine
                   learning. However, as increasingly complex and opaque models
                   have become standard practice, the process of active
                   learning, too, has become more opaque. There has been little
                   investigation into interpreting what specific trends and
                   patterns an active learning strategy may be exploring. This
                   work expands on the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
                   Explanations framework (LIME) to provide explanations for
                   active learning recommendations. We demonstrate how LIME can
                   be used to generate locally faithful explanations for an
                   active learning strategy, and how these explanations can be
                   used to understand how different models and datasets explore
                   a problem space over time. In order to quantify the
                   per-subgroup differences in how an active learning strategy
                   queries spatial regions, we introduce a notion of
                   uncertainty bias (based on disparate impact) to measure the
                   discrepancy in the confidence for a model's predictions
                   between one subgroup and another. Using the uncertainty bias
                   measure, we show that our query explanations accurately
                   reflect the subgroup focus of the active learning queries,
                   allowing for an interpretable explanation of what is being
                   learned as points with similar sources of uncertainty have
                   their uncertainty bias resolved. We demonstrate that this
                   technique can be applied to track uncertainty bias over
                   user-defined clusters or automatically generated clusters
                   based on the source of uncertainty.",

                   The language model, integrated with our improved attention

                   boxes''. In many real-world applications however, models may
                   have to sacrifice predictive power in favour of
                   human-interpretability. When this is the case, feature
                   engineering becomes a crucial task, which requires
                   significant and time-consuming human effort. Whilst some
                   features are inherently static, representing properties that
                   cannot be influenced (e.g., the age of an individual),
                   others capture characteristics that could be adjusted (e.g.,
                   the daily amount of carbohydrates taken). Nonetheless, once
                   a model is learned from the data, each prediction it makes
                   on new instances is irreversible - assuming every instance
                   to be a static point located in the chosen feature space.
                   There are many circumstances however where it is important
                   to understand (i) why a model outputs a certain prediction
                   on a given instance, (ii) which adjustable features of that
                   instance should be modified, and finally (iii) how to alter
                   such a prediction when the mutated instance is input back to
                   the model. In this paper, we present a technique that
                   exploits the internals of a tree-based ensemble classifier
                   to offer recommendations for transforming true negative

                   similarity to a human. To address these topics, we designed

                   non-humanoid, grabbing a ball. The robots either managed to

               first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or
               otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an
               intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a
               controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this
               question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape
               of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about
               oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires,
               and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and
               differential technological development; indirect normativity,
               instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology
               couplings; Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution;
               artificial intelligence, and biological cognitive enhancement,
               and collective intelligence. This profoundly ambitious and
               original book picks its way carefully through a vast tract of
               forbiddingly difficult intellectual terrain. Yet the writing is
               so lucid that it somehow makes it all seem easy. After an
               utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of
               thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent
               life, we find in Nick Bostrom's work nothing less than a
               reconceptualization of the essential task of our time.",

  abstract = "This paper provides a framework to automatically generate a
              hybrid controller that guarantees that the robot can achieve its
              task when a robot model, a class of admissible environments, and
              a high-level task or behavior for the robot are provided. The
              desired task specifications, which are expressed in a fragment of
              linear temporal logic (LTL), can capture complex robot behaviors
              such as search and rescue, coverage, and collision avoidance. In
              addition, our framework explicitly captures sensor specifications
              that depend on the environment with which the robot is
              interacting, which results in a novel paradigm for sensor-based
              temporal-logic-motion planning. As one robot is part of the
              environment of another robot, our sensor-based framework very
              naturally captures multirobot specifications in a decentralized
              manner. Our computational approach is based on first creating
              discrete controllers satisfying specific LTL formulas. If
              feasible, the discrete controller is then used to guide the
              sensor-based composition of continuous controllers, which results
              in a hybrid controller satisfying the high-level specification

               based on its role in dynamic human decision making in a variety

               concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of
               decision making. The relationship between situation awareness
               and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored.
               Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented
               as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and
               interpreting information from the environment to form situation
               awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are
               hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these

              probabilities. Although people generally demonstrate vagueness
              aversion, behaving as if vaguely specified probabilities are
              worse than comparable precisely specified probabilities,
              vagueness seeking also occurs. Previous explanations of vagueness
              preferences have been based on individual differences and
              regressive beliefs about extreme probabilities, and little
              research has examined the effect of changes in the way vagueness
              is communicated to the decision maker. The present study
              demonstrates that gain/loss framing, moderated by the
              operationalization of vagueness, influences how people respond to
              vagueness about a probability estimate. Subjects read scenarios

              a substantial primacy order effect. A second experiment

               air-ground targeting scenario. Target cueing, based upon
               semi-reliable sensor information, sometimes directs attention
               away from the true target. Yet pilots follow such guidance, even
               knowing its unreliability, a result of the difficulty of the
               unaided task. In Experiment 2, pilots in a free flight

               maneuvers, using a cockpit display of traffic information
               (CDTI). On rare trials the CDTI knowledge of the traffic

               attention to the inaccuracy of the predictor does little to
               influence pilots' reliance upon the predictor symbol although it

  abstract = "A probabilistic reinforcement learning algorithm is presented for
              finding control policies in continuous state and action spaces
              without a prior knowledge of the dynamics. The objective of this
              algorithm is to learn from minimal amount of interaction with the
              environment in order to maximize a notion of reward, i.e. a
              numerical measure of the quality of the resulting state
              trajectories. Experience from the interactions are used to
              construct a set of probabilistic Gaussian process (GP) models
              that predict the resulting state trajectories and the reward from
              executing a policy on the system. These predictions are used with
              a technique known as Bayesian optimization to search for policies
              that promise higher rewards. As more experience is gathered,
              predictions are made with more confidence and the search for
              better policies relies less on new interactions with the
              environment. The computational demand of a GP makes it eventually
              impractical to use as the number of observations from interacting
              with the environment increase. Moreover, using a single GP to
              model different regions that may exhibit disparate behaviors can
              produce unsatisfactory representations and predictions. One way
              of mitigating these issues is by partitioning the observation
              points into different regions each represented by a local GP.
              With the sequential arrival of the observation points from new
              experiences, it is necessary to have an adaptive clustering
              method that can partition the data into an appropriate number of
              regions. This led to the development of EM+ algorithm presented
              in the second part of this work, which is an extension to the
              Expectation Maximization (EM) for the Gaussian mixture models,
              that assumes no prior knowledge of the number of components.
              Lastly, an application of the EM+ algorithm to filtering problems
              is presented. We propose a filtering algorithm that combines the
              advantages of the well-known particle filter and the mixture of
              Gaussian filter, while avoiding their issues.",

               Halpern examines formal ways of representing uncertainty and
               considers various logics for reasoning about it. While the ideas
               presented are formalized in terms of definitions and theorems,
               the emphasis is on the philosophy of representing and reasoning
               about uncertainty. Halpern surveys possible formal systems for
               representing uncertainty, including probability measures,
               possibility measures, and plausibility measures; considers the
               updating of beliefs based on changing information and the
               relation to Bayes' theorem; and discusses qualitative,
               quantitative, and plausibilistic Bayesian networks.This second
               edition has been updated to reflect Halpern's recent research.
               New material includes a consideration of weighted probability
               measures and how they can be used in decision making; analyses
               of the Doomsday argument and the Sleeping Beauty problem;

  abstract  = "This paper aims to predict consumer acceptance of e-commerce by
               proposing a set of key drivers for engaging consumers in on-line
               transactions. The primary constructs for capturing consumer
               acceptance of e-commerce are intention to transact and on-line
               transaction behavior. Following the theory of reasoned action
               (TRA) as applied to a technology-driven environment, technology
               acceptance model (TAM) variables (perceived usefulness and ease
               of use) are posited as key drivers of e-commerce acceptance. The
               practical utility of TAM stems from the fact that e-commerce is
               technology-driven. The proposed model integrates trust and
               perceived risk, which are incorporated given the implicit
               uncertainty of the e-commerce environment. The proposed
               integration of the hypothesized independent variables is
               justified by placing all the variables under the nomological TRA
               structure and proposing their interrelationships. The resulting
               research model is tested using data from two empirical studies.
               The first, exploratory study comprises three experiential
               scenarios with 103 students. The second, confirmatory study uses
               a sample of 155 on-line consumers. Both studies strongly support
               the e-commerce acceptance model by validating the proposed
               hypotheses. The paper discusses the implications for e-commerce

              meaning. Conceptual confusion on trust makes comparing one trust
              study to another problematic. To facilitate cumulative trust
              research, the authors propose two kinds of trust typologies: (a)
              a classification system for types of trust, and (b) definitions
              of six related trust types that form a model. Some of the model's
              implications for management are also outlined. 2 THE MEANINGS OF
              TRUST ``...trust is a term with many meanings. '' (Williamson,
              1993: 453) ``Trust is itself a term for a clustering of
              perceptions. '' (White, 1992: 174) Scholars and practitioners
              widely acknowledge trust's importance. Trust makes cooperative
              endeavors happen (e.g., Arrow, 1974; Deutsch, 1973; Gambetta,

               trust/distrust concepts are better than other types at inducing
               consumers to trust a Web advice provider. We propose and test a
               model in which dispositional trust and distrust concepts are
               given separate roles. This unique approach is based on the
               growing, but untested theoretical consensus that trust and
               distrust are separate concepts that co-exist yet differ in terms
               of their emotional makeup. While trust concepts tend to be calm
               and collected, distrust concepts embody significant levels of
               fear and insecurity. Based on this difference, we propose that
               dispositional distrust concepts will be better predictors of
               high-risk Internet legal advice site perceptions, while the
               corresponding trust concepts will be better predictors of
               low-risk Internet legal advice site perceptions. As proposed,
               the study finds that dispositional trust better predicts
               low-risk perceptions, while dispositional distrust better
               predicts high-risk perceptions. For e-commerce advice site
               research, the findings of this article suggest that perhaps
               scholars should Not only study dispositional trust but also

  abstract  = "Tested a theoretical model of interpersonal trust in close
               relationships with 47 dating, cohabiting, or married couples
               (mean ages were 31 yrs for males and 29 yrs for females). The
               validity of the model's 3 dimensions of trust---predictability,
               dependability, and faith---was examined. Ss completed scales
               designed to measure liking and loving, trust, and motivation for
               maintaining the relationship. An analysis of the instrument
               measuring trust was consistent with the notion that the
               predictability, dependability, and faith components represent
               distinct and coherent dimensions. The perception of intrinsic
               motives in a partner emerged as a dimension, as did instrumental
               and extrinsic motives. As expected, love and happiness were
               closely tied to feelings of faith and the attribution of
               intrinsic motivation to both self and partner. Women appeared to
               have more integrated, complex views of their relationships than
               men: All 3 forms of trust were strongly related, and
               attributions of instrumental motives in their partners seemed to
               be self-affirming. There was a tendency for Ss to view their own
               motives as less self-centered and more exclusively intrinsic
               than their partner's motives. (25 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record

               of their actions become more serious. With today's GUIs, user
               and software errors can often be easily fixed or undone. An
               agent performing actions on behalf of a user could make errors
               that are very difficult to ``undo'', and, depending on the
               agent's complexity, it might not be clear what went wrong.
               Moreover, for agents to operate effectively and truly act on
               their users' behalf, they might need confidential or sensitive
               information. This includes financial details and personal
               contact information. Thus, along with the excitement about
               agents and what they can do, there is concern about the
               resulting security and privacy issues. It is not enough to
               assume that well-designed software agents will provide the

               performance. This often overlooked second-order information

               Our motivation here is to improve the performance of the popular

               truly large-scale field operation. When using the taught route

               exactly, or is sufficiently close to, the original path,
               enabling successful localisation. However, what happens if it is
               not possible, or not desirable to exactly follow the mapped
               path? How far off the beaten track can the robot travel before
               it gets lost? We present an approach for assessing this
               localisation area around a taught route, which we refer to as
               the localisation envelope. Using a combination of physical
               sampling and a Gaussian Process model, we are able to accurately

               amounts of labeled training data. However, obtaining such data
               can be a difficult and time-consuming endeavor. We have
               developed a novel, entropy-based ldquoactive learningrdquo
               approach which makes significant progress towards this problem.
               The main idea is to sequentially acquire labeled data by
               presenting an oracle (the user) with unlabeled images that will
               be particularly informative when labeled. Active learning
               adaptively prioritizes the order in which the training examples
               are acquired, which, as shown by our experiments, can
               significantly reduce the overall number of training examples
               required to reach near-optimal performance. At first glance this
               may seem counter-intuitive: how can the algorithm know whether a
               group of unlabeled images will be informative, when, by
               definition, there is no label directly associated with any of
               the images? Our approach is based on choosing an image to label
               that maximizes the expected amount of information we gain about
               the set of unlabeled images. The technique is demonstrated in
               several contexts, including improving the efficiency of Web
               image-search queries and open-world visual learning by an
               autonomous agent. Experiments on a large set of 140 visual
               object categories taken directly from text-based Web image
               searches show that our technique can provide large improvements
               (up to 10 x reduction in the number of training examples needed)

               to classification problems is the large amount of labeled
               training data required. Especially for images and video,
               providing training data is very expensive in terms of human time
               and effort. In this paper we propose an active learning approach
               to tackle the problem. Instead of passively accepting random
               training examples, the active learning algorithm iteratively
               selects unlabeled examples for the user to label, so that human
               effort is focused on labeling the most ``useful'' examples. Our
               method relies on the idea of uncertainty sampling, in which the
               algorithm selects unlabeled examples that it finds hardest to
               classify. Specifically, we propose an uncertainty measure that
               generalizes margin-based uncertainty to the multi-class case and
               is easy to compute, so that active learning can handle a large
               number of classes and large data sizes efficiently. We
               demonstrate results for letter and digit recognition on datasets
               from the UCI repository, object recognition results on the
               Caltech-101 dataset, and scene categorization results on a
               dataset of 13 natural scene categories. The proposed method
               gives large reductions in the number of training examples

               are typically non-probabilistic, predicting class labels but not
               directly providing an estimate of uncertainty. Gaussian
               Processes (GPs) provide a framework for deriving regression
               techniques with explicit uncertainty models; we show here how
               Gaussian Processes with covariance functions defined based on a
               Pyramid Match Kernel (PMK) can be used for probabilistic object

               learn an optimal combination of multiple covariance functions.
               It also offers confidence estimates at test points, and
               naturally allows for an active learning paradigm in which points

              interpersonal trust capture some important aspects of the nature
              and dynamics of human-machine trust. Results showed that
              operators' subjective ratings of trust in the automation were
              based mainly upon their perception of its competence. Trust was
              significantly reduced by any sign of incompetence in the
              automation, even one which had no effect on overall system
              performance. Operators' trust changed very little with
              experience, with a few notable exceptions. Distrust in one
              function of an automatic component spread to reduce trust in
              another function of the same component, but did not generalize to
              another independent automatic component in the same system, or to
              other systems. There was high positive correlation between
              operators' trust in and use of the automation; operators used
              automation they trusted and rejected automation they distrusted,
              preferring to do the control task manually. There was an inverse
              relationship between trust and monitoring of the automation.
              These results suggest that operators' subjective ratings of trust

              operator's choice of automatic or manual control has important
              consequences for system performance, and therefore it is
              important to understand and optimize this decision process. One
              important determinant of operators' choice of manual or automatic

              the human-machine relationship. The resulting model defines human
              trust in machines and specifies how trust changes with experience

               classification methods to action-selection tasks in robotics,
               and argues that a classifier's introspective capacity is a vital
               but as yet largely under-appreciated attribute. As illustration
               we propose an active learning framework for semantic mapping in
               mobile robotics and demonstrate it in the context of autonomous
               driving. In this framework, data are selected for label
               disambiguation by a human supervisor using uncertainty sampling.
               Intuitively, an introspective classification framework---i.e.
               one which moderates its predictions by an estimate of how well
               it is placed to make a call in a particular situation---is
               particularly well suited to this task. To achieve an efficient
               implementation we extend the notion of introspection to a
               particular sparse Gaussian Process Classifier, the Informative
               Vector Machine (IVM). Furthermore, we leverage the
               information-theoretic nature of the IVM to formulate a
               principled mechanism for forgetting stale data, thereby bounding
               memory use and resulting in a truly life-long learning system.
               Our evaluation on a publicly available dataset shows that an
               introspective active learner asks more informative questions
               compared to a more traditional non-introspective approach like a
               Support Vector Machine (SVM) and in so doing, outperforms the
               SVM in terms of learning rate while retaining efficiency for

               contrast to prior art, our system is able to predict this

                   systematically: we present an algorithm to find the optimal
                   partition of the data subject to certain constraints. While
                   doing this, we address two critical issues: 1) that the
                   model be evaluated with respect to predictions of a given
                   quantity of interest and its ability to reproduce the data,
                   and 2) that the model be highly challenged by the validation
                   set, assuming it is properly informed by the calibration
                   set. This framework also relies on the interaction between
                   the experimentalist and/or modeler, who understand the
                   physical system and the limitations of the model; the
                   decision-maker, who understands and can quantify the cost of
                   model failure; and the computational scientists, who strive
                   to determine if the model satisfies both the modeler's and
                   decision maker's requirements. We also note that our
                   framework is quite general, and may be applied to a wide
                   range of problems. Here, we illustrate it through a specific
                   example involving a data reduction model for an ICCD camera
                   from a shock-tube experiment located at the NASA Ames
                   Research Center (ARC).",

  author   = "Morrison, Rebecca E and Oliver, Todd A and Moser, Robert D",
  abstract = "Mathematical models of physical systems are subject to many
              uncertainties such as measurement errors and uncertain initial
              and boundary conditions. After accounting for these
              uncertainties, it is often revealed that discrepancies between
              the model output and the observations remain; if so, the model is
              said to be inadequate. In practice, the inadequate model may be
              the best that is available or tractable, and so despite its
              inadequacy the model may be used to make predictions of
              unobserved quantities. In this case, a representation of the
              inadequacy is necessary, so the impact of the observed
              discrepancy can be determined. We investigate this problem in the
              context of chemical kinetics and propose a new technique to
              account for model inadequacy that is both probabilistic and
              physically meaningful. A stochastic inadequacy operator
              $\mathcal\{S\}$ is introduced which is embedded in the ODEs
              describing the evolution of chemical species concentrations and
              which respects certain physical constraints such as conservation
              laws. The parameters of $\mathcal\{S\}$ are governed by
              probability distributions, which in turn are characterized by a
              set of hyperparameters. The model parameters and hyperparameters
              are calibrated using high-dimensional hierarchical Bayesian
              inference. We apply the method to a typical problem in chemical
              kinetics---the reaction mechanism of hydrogen combustion.",

               or the perceived risk of having personal information stolen by
               hackers. Trust plays a central role in helping consumers
               overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity. Trust makes
               consumers comfortable sharing personal information, making
               purchases, and acting on Web vendor advice---behaviors essential
               to widespread adoption of e-commerce. Therefore, trust is
               critical to both researchers and practitioners. Prior research
               on e-commerce trust has used diverse, incomplete, and
               inconsistent definitions of trust, making it difficult to
               compare results across studies. This paper contributes by
               proposing and validating measures for a multidisciplinary,
               multidimensional model of trust in e-commerce. The model
               includes four high-level constructs---disposition to trust,
               institution-based trust, trusting beliefs, and trusting
               intentions---which are further delineated into 16 measurable,
               literature-grounded subconstructs. The psychometric properties
               of the measures are demonstrated through use of a hypothetical,
               legal advice Web site. The results show that trust is indeed a
               multidimensional concept. Proposed relationships among the trust
               constructs are tested (for internal nomological validity), as
               are relationships between the trust constructs and three other

              decision support (CDS) systems have evolved from interpretable
              and easy-to-use scoring systems to very complex and
              non-interpretable mathematical models. In order to accomplish
              effective decision support, CDS systems should provide
              information on how the model arrives at a certain decision. To
              address the issue of incompatibility between performance,

              proposes an innovative model structure, automatically leading to
              interpretable and easily applicable models. The resulting models

              improve communication with patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
              propose the interval coded scoring (ICS) system, which imposes
              that the effect of each variable on the estimated risk is
              constant within consecutive intervals. The number and position of
              the intervals are automatically obtained by solving an
              optimization problem, which additionally performs variable
              selection. The resulting model can be visualised by means of
              appealing scoring tables and color bars. ICS models can be used
              within software packages, in smartphone applications, or on
              paper, which is particularly useful for bedside medicine and
              home-monitoring. The ICS approach is illustrated on two
              gynecological problems: diagnosis of malignancy of ovarian tumors
              using a dataset containing 3,511 patients, and prediction of
              first trimester viability of pregnancies using a dataset of 1,435
              women. Comparison of the performance of the ICS approach with a
              range of prediction models proposed in the literature illustrates
              the ability of ICS to combine optimal performance with the
              interpretability of simple scoring systems. CONCLUSIONS: The ICS
              approach can improve patient-clinician communication and will
              provide additional insights in the importance and influence of
              available variables. Future challenges include extensions of the
              proposed methodology towards automated detection of interaction
              effects, multi-class decision support systems, prognosis and
              high-dimensional data.",

               techniques to overcome ``covariate shift'' non-stationarity. As
               the power of computing has grown over the past few decades, the
               field of machine learning has advanced rapidly in both theory
               and practice. Machine learning methods are usually based on the
               assumption that the data generation mechanism does not change
               over time. Yet real-world applications of machine learning,
               including image recognition, natural language processing, speech
               recognition, robot control, and bioinformatics, often violate
               this common assumption. Dealing with non-stationarity is one of
               modern machine learning's greatest challenges. This book focuses
               on a specific non-stationary environment known as covariate
               shift, in which the distributions of inputs (queries) change but
               the conditional distribution of outputs (answers) is unchanged,
               and presents machine learning theory, algorithms, and
               applications to overcome this variety of non-stationarity. After
               reviewing the state-of-the-art research in the field, the
               authors discuss topics that include learning under covariate
               shift, model selection, importance estimation, and active

               covariate shift adaption as brain-computer interface, speaker

  abstract = "AbstractObjectives Quantification and early identification of
              unplanned readmission risk have the potential to improve the
              quality of care during hospitalization and after discharge.
              However, high dimensionality, sparsity, and class imbalance of
              electronic health data and the complexity of risk quantification,
              challenge the development of accurate predictive models.
              Predictive models require a certain level of interpretability in
              order to be applicable in real settings and create actionable
              insights. This paper aims to develop accurate and interpretable
              predictive models for readmission in a general pediatric patient
              population, by integrating a data-driven model (sparse logistic
              regression) and domain knowledge based on the international
              classification of diseases 9th---revision clinical modification
              (ICD-9-CM) hierarchy of diseases. Additionally, we propose a way
              to quantify the interpretability of a model and inspect the
              stability of alternative solutions. Materials and methods The
              analysis was conducted on >66,000 pediatric hospital discharge
              records from California, State Inpatient Databases, Healthcare
              Cost and Utilization Project between 2009 and 2011. We
              incorporated domain knowledge based on the ICD-9-CM hierarchy in
              a data driven, Tree-Lasso regularized logistic regression model,
              providing the framework for model interpretation. This approach
              was compared with traditional Lasso logistic regression resulting
              in models that are easier to interpret by fewer high-level
              diagnoses, with comparable prediction accuracy. Results The
              results revealed that the use of a Tree-Lasso model was as
              competitive in terms of accuracy (measured by area under the
              receiver operating characteristic curve---AUC) as the traditional
              Lasso logistic regression, but integration with the ICD-9-CM
              hierarchy of diseases provided more interpretable models in terms
              of high-level diagnoses. Additionally, interpretations of models
              are in accordance with existing medical understanding of
              pediatric readmission. Best performing models have similar
              performances reaching AUC values 0.783 and 0.779 for traditional
              Lasso and Tree-Lasso, respectfully. However, information loss of
              Lasso models is 0.35 bits higher compared to Tree-Lasso model.
              Conclusions We propose a method for building predictive models
              applicable for the detection of readmission risk based on
              Electronic Health records. Integration of domain knowledge (in
              the form of ICD-9-CM taxonomy) and a data-driven, sparse
              predictive algorithm (Tree-Lasso Logistic Regression) resulted in
              an increase of interpretability of the resulting model. The
              models are interpreted for the readmission prediction problem in
              general pediatric population in California, as well as several
              important subpopulations, and the interpretations of models
              comply with existing medical understanding of pediatric
              readmission. Finally, quantitative assessment of the
              interpretability of the models is given, that is beyond simple

                   Q-network (DQN) algorithm is doomed by a Sisyphean curse.
                   Owing to the use of function approximation, these agents
                   eventually forget experiences as they become exceedingly
                   unlikely under a new policy. Consequently, for as long as

              constructed that allows the analysts to provide classifications
              or predictions for new observations. Currently, most research
              focuses on improving the accuracy or precision of these models
              and comparatively little research has been undertaken to increase
              their comprehensibility to the analyst or end-user. This is
              mainly due to the subjective nature of `comprehensibility', which
              depends on many factors outside the model, such as the user's
              experience and his/her prior knowledge. Despite this influence of
              the observer, some representation formats are generally
              considered to be more easily interpretable than others. In this
              paper, an empirical study is presented which investigates the
              suitability of a number of alternative representation formats for
              classification when interpretability is a key requirement. The

               machine collaboration",

  abstract  = "I envision a system that enables successful collaborations
               between humans and machine learning models by harnessing the
               relative strength to accomplish what neither can do alone.
               Machine learning techniques and humans have skills that
               complement each other - machine learning techniques are good at
               computation on data at the lowest level of granularity, whereas
               people are better at abstracting knowledge from their
               experience, and transferring the knowledge across domains. The
               goal of this thesis is to develop a framework for
               human-in-the-loop machine learning that enables people to
               interact effectively with machine learning models to make better
               decisions, without requiring in-depth knowledge about machine
               learning techniques. Many of us interact with machine learning
               systems everyday. Systems that mine data for product
               recommendations, for example, are ubiquitous. However these
               systems compute their output without end-user involvement, and
               there are typically no life or death consequences in the case
               the machine learning result is not acceptable to the user. In
               contrast, domains where decisions can have serious consequences
               (e.g., emergency response panning, medical decision-making),
               require the incorporation of human experts' domain knowledge.
               These systems also must be transparent to earn experts' trust
               and be adopted in their workflow. The challenge addressed in
               this thesis is that traditional machine learning systems are not
               designed to extract domain experts' knowledge from natural
               workflow, or to provide pathways for the human domain expert to
               directly interact with the algorithm to interject their
               knowledge or to better understand the system output. For machine
               learning systems to make a real-world impact in these important
               domains, these systems must be able to communicate with highly
               skilled human experts to leverage their judgment and expertise,
               and share useful information or patterns from the data. In this
               thesis, I bridge this gap by building human-in-the-loop machine
               learning models and systems that compute and communicate machine
               learning results in ways that are compatible with the human
               decision-making process, and that can readily incorporate human
               experts' domain knowledge. I start by building a machine
               learning model that infers human teams' planning decisions from
               the structured form of natural language of team meetings. I show
               that the model can infer a human teams' final plan with 86\%
               accuracy on average. I then design an interpretable machine
               learning model then ``makes sense to humans'' by exploring and
               communicating patterns and structure in data to support human
               decision-making. Through human subject experiments, I show that
               this interpretable machine learning model offers statistically
               significant quantitative improvements in interpretability while
               preserving clustering performance. Finally, I design a machine
               learning model that supports transparent interaction with humans
               without requiring that a user has expert knowledge of machine
               learning technique. I build a human-in-the-loop machine learning
               system that incorporates human feedback and communicates its
               internal states to humans, using an intuitive medium for
               interaction with the machine learning model. I demonstrate the
               application of this model for an educational domain in which
               teachers cluster programming assignments to streamline the
               grading process.",

               interpretability, but for complex data sets, simple parametric
               models may lack expressive power, and their more complex
               counterparts (such as feed forward neural networks) may not be
               easy to work with in practice. The advent of kernel machines,
               such as Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Processes has
               opened the possibility of flexible models which are practical to
               work with. In this short tutorial we present the basic idea on
               how Gaussian Process models can be used to formulate a Bayesian
               framework for regression. We will focus on understanding the
               stochastic process and how it is used in supervised learning.
               Secondly, we will discuss practical matters regarding the role
               of hyperparameters in the covariance function, the marginal
               likelihood and the automatic Occam's razor. For broader
               introductions to Gaussian processes, consult [1], [2]. 1
               Gaussian Processes In this section we define Gaussian Processes
               and show how they can very naturally be used to define
               distributions over functions. In the following section we
               continue to show how this distribution is updated in the light
               of training examples. 1 By a parametric model, we here mean a
               model which during training ``absorbs '' the information from
               the training data into the parameters; after training the data
               can be discarded.",

              genetics-based machine learning (GBML) algorithm. Our GBML
              algorithm is a hybrid version of Michigan and Pittsburgh
              approaches, which is implemented in the framework of evolutionary
              multiobjective optimization (EMO). Each fuzzy rule is represented
              by its antecedent fuzzy sets as an integer string of fixed
              length. Each fuzzy rule-based classifier, which is a set of fuzzy
              rules, is represented as a concatenated integer string of
              variable length. Our GBML algorithm simultaneously maximizes the
              accuracy of rule sets and minimizes their complexity. The
              accuracy is measured by the number of correctly classified
              training patterns while the complexity is measured by the number
              of fuzzy rules and/or the total number of antecedent conditions

                   neural networks have succeeded in building rich
                   representations using either compressive, reconstructive or
                   supervised criteria. However, the semantic structure
                   inherent in observations is oftentimes lost in the process.
                   Human perception excels at understanding semantics but
                   cannot always be expressed in terms of labels. Thus,
                   \textbackslashemph\{oracles\} or
                   \textbackslashemph\{human-in-the-loop systems\}, for example

                   constraints using an implicit similarity function encoded in
                   human perception. In this work we propose to combine

                   previous metric learning approaches as well as generative
                   models without this side-information in a variety of

  abstract = "We present a shared-control framework predicated on a measure of
              trust in the operator, that is calculated automatically based on
              the quality of the interactions between a human and autonomous
              system. This measure of trust is built upon a control-theoretic
              foundation that rewards stable operation of the system to give
              more trusted users additional control authority. The level of
              control authority is used to modify the human input, and as a
              result, we observe a minimization of the required effort of the
              controller. We validate this work within a planar crane
              environment with a receding horizon controller to assist with the
              regulation of the system dynamics. The human defines the
              reference trajectory for the controller. In an experimental study
              users navigate a suspended payload through a set of maze
              configurations. We find that adaptation of the trust metric over
              time provides the benefit of substantially ( $p <; 0.01$)
              improving the automated system's ability to modulate the user's
              input, resulting in stable reference trajectories that require
              less effort to track. In effect, the human and automation spend
              less time fighting each other during task execution, suggesting

               this challenge, we consider in this paper the problem of
               synthesizing safety controllers for linear parameter-varying
               subsystems, where the system matrices of each subsystem depend
               (possibly nonlinearly) on the states of the other subsystems. In

               invariant sets and associated controllers, that is robust
               against affine parametric uncertainties in the system matrices.
               Then we show for certain classes of parameter dependencies how
               to quantify the uncertainty imposed on the other subsystems by
               convexifying, with an affine map, the effects of these
               parameters. An analysis of this quantification is provided. In

               global mission, specified as regular languages over all the
               agents' capabilities, whereas basic motion controllers for each
               agent shall be designed with respect to given environment

  abstract  = "Data integrity is a property which a world state interpreted
               with a world model is consistent with the real operating
               environment. Even a formally verified safety claim of an
               autonomous system is prone to a malfunction caused by loss of
               data integrity. From a first-person viewpoint in a congested
               environment, some components of measurable part of the world
               state may become transiently deficient or unavailable because of
               the limited capability of sensor devices. If the system could
               get into a situation where the world state becomes suddenly
               unobservable, existing estimation methods may get unstable.
               These methods can hardly detect the loss of data integrity and
               produce an incorrect estimate without any notice. Our insight is
               that we can merge the original concept of observer theory with
               that of automated reasoning. Firstly, we propose a new way of
               unifying them into a problem of checking satisfiability of a
               formula that consists of predicates regarding the world model
               and decision variables regarding unmeasurable part of the world
               state. We can detect a loss of data integrity by checking if the
               problem is unsatisfiable. Secondly, we replace the idea of
               observability in control theory with identifiability with
               respect to a measure of tolerance and a world model. We show a
               procedure of estimating the world state with a bounded
               uncertainty specified by the measure of tolerance. Third, we
               show that a problem of sensor fusion, a problem of reasoning a
               world state of discrete and enumerated type, and a decision
               problem under uncertainty in the world state are formulated as
               an identifiability problem. The proposal presents a constructive
               basis for supporting the degree of confidence in the estimated
               world state.",

  abstract = "Technical developments in computer hardware and software now make
              it possible to introduce automation into virtually all aspects of
              human-machine systems. Given these technical capabilities, which
              system functions should be automated and to what extent? We
              outline a model for types and levels of automation that provides
              a framework and an objective basis for making such choices.
              Appropriate selection is important because automation does not
              merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new
              coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that
              automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1)
              information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and
              action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of
              these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of
              levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully
              automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four
              types at different levels. The human performance consequences of
              particular types and levels of automation constitute primary
              evaluative criteria for automation design using our model.
              Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and
              the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples

               In this paper we provide a survey that, far from being
               exhaustive, intends to show the most representative models that
               currently exist in the literature. For this enterprise we
               consider several dimensions of analysis that appeared in three

               complementary to the existing ones and that have not been

               in which trust and reputation representation as mental attitudes
               is as important as the final values of trust and reputation.

  abstract  = "An important aspect of a robot's social behavior is to convey
               the right amount of trustworthiness. Task performance has shown
               to be an important source for trustworthiness judgments. Here,
               we argue that factors such as a robot's behavioral style can
               play an important role as well. Our approach to studying the
               effects of a robot's performance and behavioral style on human
               trust involves experiments with simulated robots in video
               human--robot interaction (VHRI) and immersive virtual
               environments (IVE). Although VHRI and IVE settings cannot
               substitute for the genuine interaction with a real robot, they
               can provide useful complementary approaches to experimental
               research in social human robot interaction. VHRI enables rapid
               prototyping of robot behaviors. Simulating human--robot
               interaction in IVEs can be a useful tool for measuring human
               responses to robots and help avoid the many constraints caused
               by real-world hardware. However, there are also difficulties
               with the generalization of results from one setting (e.g., VHRI)
               to another (e.g. IVE or the real world), which we discuss. In
               this paper, we use animated robot avatars in VHRI to rapidly
               identify robot behavioral styles that affect human trust
               assessment of the robot. In a subsequent study, we use an IVE to
               measure behavioral interaction between humans and an animated
               robot avatar equipped with behaviors from the VHRI experiment.
               Our findings reconfirm that a robot's task performance
               influences its trustworthiness, but the effect of the behavioral
               style identified in the VHRI study did not influence the robot's
               trustworthiness in the IVE study.",

               for autonomous hybrid teams (i.e., arbitrary combinations of
               humans, robots and machines), which cannot be done presently.
               Uncertainty is created in states of interdependence between
               social objects: at one extreme, interdependence reduces to
               independent agents and certainty but with asocial, low-power
               solutions generating little meaning or understanding in social
               contexts; oppositely, the length of interdependence increases
               across a group, de-individuating its members until individual
               identity dissolves (e.g., cults, gangs, well-run teams),
               increasing power, efficiency and meaning internal to a group,
               but also the chances of mal-adaptation (e.g., tragic mistakes).
               We focus on how interdependence increases the robust
               intelligence of a group by increasing its autonomy while
               decreasing its entropy, but requiring external control to be
               indirect. For humans, teamwork is an unsolved theoretical
               problem; solving it should generalize to the effective
               computational control of hybrid teams, a path forward for the
               users of a team to trust it to operate safely in hostile
               environments. Present theories of interdependence, like game
               theory or social science, are inadequate to formulate strategies
               to control teams; alternative theories like machine learning can
               control swarms with pattern formations, but not states of
               interdependence, such as multi-tasking operations. While
               alternative theories cannot be used to model teams,

               performance in human-agent teams. In applications such as search
               and rescue, command and control, and air traffic control,
               operators in the future will likely need to work in teams
               together with robots. It is critical to understand how these
               teams could be robust against uncertainty and what influences
               team performance. We conducted two experiments in which teams of
               three operators controlled simulated heterogeneous robots on the
               same testbed. Experiment 1 investigated the impact of team
               structure and uncertainty of task arrival processes on team
               coordination and performance. Experiment 2 explored the usage of
               information-sharing tools under different uncertainty levels. In
               Experiment 1, it was found that divisional teams were more
               robust against the uncertainty on task arrival processes.
               However, this robustness was achieved with an overall worse
               performance compared to functional teams. Three reasons for the
               degraded performance were identified, namely duplication on task
               assignment, under-utilization of vehicles, and infrequent
               communication. In Experiment 2, it was found that
               information-sharing tools reduced the duplication on task
               assignments, improved overall task performance, and reduced
               workload. These results provide insights for achieving robust
               and effective teamwork. This goal can be achieved by using a
               team structure that could adapt to uncertainties together with
               effective information-sharing tools. These findings could inform
               the design of robust teams and the development of
               information-sharing tools to improve teamwork.",

               develop a time-series trust model for human-robot collaboration
               tasks, which is a function of prior trust, robot performance,
               and human performance. The robot performance is evaluated by its
               flexibility to keep pace with the human coworker and is molded
               as the difference between human and robot speed. The human
               performance in doing physical tasks is directly related to

               behaviors. More importantly, when problems arise within complex

               state trajectories within complex autonomous systems in terms of
               mission context to allow efficient management of aberrant
               behavior. This information will provide the user with improved
               feedback about system behavior, which will in turn lead to more
               relevant and effective prescriptions for interaction,
               particularly during emergency procedures. This, in turn, will
               enable proper trust calibration. We also argue that by
               understanding the context of the user's decisions or system's
               actions (seamless integration of the human), the autonomous
               platform can provide more appropriate information to the user.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of exogenous oxytocin on
              trust, compliance, and team decision making with agents varying
              in anthropomorphism (computer, avatar, human) and reliability
              (100\%, 50\%). BACKGROUND: Authors of recent work have explored
              psychological similarities in how people trust humanlike
              automation compared with how they trust other humans. Exogenous
              administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide associated with trust
              among humans, offers a unique opportunity to probe the
              anthropomorphism continuum of automation to infer when agents are
              trusted like another human or merely a machine. METHOD:
              Eighty-four healthy male participants collaborated with automated
              agents varying in anthropomorphism that provided recommendations
              in a pattern recognition task. RESULTS: Under placebo,
              participants exhibited less trust and compliance with automated
              aids as the anthropomorphism of those aids increased. Under
              oxytocin, participants interacted with aids on the extremes of
              the anthropomorphism continuum similarly to placebos but
              increased their trust, compliance, and performance with the
              avatar, an agent on the midpoint of the anthropomorphism
              continuum. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence
              that administration of exogenous oxytocin affected trust,
              compliance, and team decision making with automated agents. These
              effects provide support for the premise that oxytocin increases
              affinity for social stimuli in automated aids. APPLICATION:
              Designing automation to mimic basic human characteristics is
              sufficient to elicit behavioral trust outcomes that are driven by
              neurological processes typically observed in human-human
              interactions. Designers of automated systems should consider the
              task, the individual, and the level of anthropomorphism to
              achieve the desired outcome.",

              trust in computerized systems and the use of those systems, we
              need to be able to effectively measure trust. Although
              questionnaires regarding trust have been used in prior studies,
              these questionnaires were theoretically rather than empirically
              generated and did not distinguish between three potentially
              different types of trust: human-human trust, human-machine trust,
              and trust in general. A 3-phased experiment, comprising a word

              differences in the concepts of trust and distrust, and among the
              different types of trust. Results indicated that trust and
              distrust can be considered opposites, rather than different
              concepts. Components of trust, in terms of words related to
              trust, were similar across the three types of trust. Results
              obtained from a cluster analysis were used to identify 12
              potential factors of trust between people and automated systems.

              from that of an active controller to that of a supervisory
              controller. Acting as supervisors, operators can choose between
              automatic and manual control. Improperly allocating function
              between automatic and manual control can have negative
              consequences for the performance of a system. Previous research
              suggests that the decision to perform the job manually or

  abstract = "The relationship between trust and control is quite relevant both
              for the very notion of trust and for modelling and implementing
              trust-control relations with autonomous systems, but it is not
              trivial at all. On the one side, it is true that where / when
              there is control there is no trust, and vice versa. However, this
              refers to a restricted notion of trust: i.e., ``trust in y,''
              which is just a part, a component of the global trust needed for
              relying on the action of another agent. It is claimed that
              control is antagonistic of this strict form of trust; but also
              that it completes and complements it for arriving to a global
              trust. In other words, putting control and guarantees is
              trust-building; it produces a sufficient trust, when trust in y's
              autonomous willingness and competence would not be enough. It is
              also argued that control requires new forms of trust: trust in
              the control itself or in the controller, trust in y as for being
              monitored and controlled; trust in possible authorities, etc.
              Finally, it is shown that, paradoxically, control could not be
              antagonistic of strict trust in y, but it can even create and
              increase it by making y more willing or more effective. In
              conclusion, depending on the circumstances, control makes y more
              reliable or less reliable; control can either decrease or
              increase trust. Two kinds of control are also analyzed,
              characterized by two different functions: ``pushing or
              influencing control'' aimed at preventing violations or mistakes,
              versus ``safety, correction, or adjustment control'' aimed at
              preventing failure or damages after a violation or a mistake. A
              good theory of trust cannot be complete without a theory of
              control.",

              decision-making and contracting in human societies. In artificial
              societies, this concept has been neglected until recently. The
              inherent benevolence assumption implemented in many multiagent
              systems can have hazardous consequences when dealing with deceit

              mechanism that helps agents to cope with environments inhabited
              by both selfish and cooperative entities. This is achieved by
              enabling agents to evaluate trust in others. A formalization and
              an algorithm for trust are presented so that agents can
              autonomously deal with deception and identify trustworthy parties
              in open systems. The approach is twofold: agents can observe the
              behavior of others and thus collect information for establishing
              an initial trust model. In order to adapt quickly to a new or
              rapidly changing environment, one enables agents to also make use
              of observations from other agents. The practical relevance of

              have been qualitative or descriptive. Our quantitative review
              provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both
              theory and practice. METHOD: Meta-analytic methods were applied
              to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29
              empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection
              criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental
              analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47
              experimental effect sizes. RESULTS: The overall correlational
              effect size for trust was r = +0.26,with an experimental effect
              size of d = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental

              robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to
              the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played
              only a moderate role. CONCLUSION: Factors related to the robot
              itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current
              association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately
              associated. There was little evidence for effects of
              human-related factors. APPLICATION: The findings provide
              quantitative estimates of human, robot, and environmental factors
              influencing HRI trust. Specifically, the current summary provides
              effect size estimates that are useful in establishing design and
              training guidelines with reference to robot-related factors of
              HRI trust. Furthermore, results indicate that improper trust
              calibration may be mitigated by the manipulation of robot design.
              However, many future research needs are identified.",

               this work was to create and validate a reliable scale that could
               measure changes in an individual's trust in a robot. Assessment
               of current trust theory identified measurable antecedents
               specific to the human, the robot, and the environment. Six
               experiments subsumed the development of the 40 item trust scale.
               Scale development included the creation of a 156 item pool. Two
               experiments identified the robot features and perceived
               functional characteristics that were related to the
               classification of a machine as a robot for this item pool. Item
               pool reduction techniques and subject matter expert (SME)
               content validation were used to reduce the scale to 42 items.
               The two final experiments were then conducted to validate the
               scale. The finalized 40 item pre-post interaction trust scale
               was designed to measure trust perceptions specific to
               human-robot interaction. The scale measures trust on a 0--100 \%
               rating scale and provides a percentage trust score. A 14 item
               sub-scale of this final version of the test recommended by SMEs

  abstract  = "It is envisioned that a human operator is able to monitor and
               control one or more (semi)autonomous underwater robots
               simultaneously in future marine operations. To enable such
               operations, a human operator must trust the capability of a
               robot to perform tasks autonomously, and the robot must
               establish its trust to the human operator based on human
               performance and follow guidance accordingly. Therefore, we seek
               to i model the mutual trust between humans and robots
               (especially (semi)autonomous underwater robots in this chapter),
               and ii) develop a set of trust-based algorithms to control the
               human-robot team so that the mutual trust level can be
               maintained at a desired level. We propose a time series based
               mutual trust model that takes into account robot performance,
               human performance and overall human-robot system fault rates.
               The robot performance model captures the performance evolution
               of a robot under autonomous mode and teleoperated mode,
               respectively. Furthermore, we specialize the robot performance
               model of a YSI EcoMapper autonomous underwater robot based on
               its distance to a desired waypoint. The human performance model
               is inspired by the Yerkes-Dodson law in psychology, which
               describes the relationship between human arousal and
               performance. Based on the mutual trust model, we first study a
               simple case of one human operator controlling a single robot and
               propose a trust-triggered control strategy depending on the
               limit conditions of the desired trust region. The method is then
               enhanced for the case of one human operator controlling a swarm
               of robots. In this framework, a periodic trust-based control
               strategy with a highest-trust-first scheduling algorithm is
               proposed. Matlab simulation results are provided to validate the
               proposed model and control strategies that guarantee effective
               real-time scheduling of teleoperated and autonomous controls in
               both one human one underwater robot case and one human multiple

               through the use of values found within all multiagent systems.
               The following values are manifested within multiagent systems:

               recognized as one of the key factors for successful electronic
               commerce adoption. In electronic commerce problems of trust are
               magnified, because agents reach out far beyond their familiar
               trade environments. Also it is far from obvious whether existing
               paper-based techniques for fraud detection and prevention are
               adequate to establish trust in an electronic network environment
               where you usually never meet your trade partner face to face,

               important, and better models of trust and deception are needed.
               One trend is that in electronic communication channels extra

                   mitigate the potential risk from a misbehaving AI system is
                   the ability to turn the system off. As the capabilities of
                   AI systems improve, it is important to ensure that such
                   systems do not adopt subgoals that prevent a human from
                   switching them off. This is a challenge because many
                   formulations of rational agents create strong incentives for
                   self-preservation. This is not caused by a built-in
                   instinct, but because a rational agent will maximize
                   expected utility and cannot achieve whatever objective it
                   has been given if it is dead. Our goal is to study the
                   incentives an agent has to allow itself to be switched off.
                   We analyze a simple game between a human H and a robot R,
                   where H can press R's off switch but R can disable the off
                   switch. A traditional agent takes its reward function for
                   granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to
                   disable the off switch, except in the special case where H
                   is perfectly rational. Our key insight is that for R to want
                   to preserve its off switch, it needs to be uncertain about
                   the utility associated with the outcome, and to treat H's
                   actions as important observations about that utility. (R
                   also has no incentive to switch itself off in this setting.)
                   We conclude that giving machines an appropriate level of
                   uncertainty about their objectives leads to safer designs,
                   and we argue that this setting is a useful generalization of
                   the classical AI paradigm of rational agents.",

               evolutionary programming. The algorithms are presented within a

               results regarding the role of mutation and selection in genetic
               algorithms, showing how mutation seems to be much more important
               for the performance of genetic algorithms than usually assumed.
               The interaction of selection and mutation, and the impact of the
               binary code are further topics of interest. Some of the

                   opposed to standard EEG analysis techniques that ignore such

                   pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual
                   classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to

                   performance, questions naturally arise as to what
                   differences remain between computer and human vision. A
                   recent study revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a
                   lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to
                   label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling
                   a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy
                   to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to
                   humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be
                   recognizable objects with 99.99\% confidence (e.g. labeling
                   with certainty that white noise static is a lion).
                   Specifically, we take convolutional neural networks trained

                   reinforcement learning based on decomposing the target
                   Markov decision process (MDP) into a hierarchy of smaller
                   MDPs and decomposing the value function of the target MDP
                   into an additive combination of the value functions of the
                   smaller MDPs. The paper defines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves
                   formal results on its representational power, and
                   establishes five conditions for the safe use of state
                   abstractions. The paper presents an online model-free
                   learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves that it converges wih
                   probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known as a
                   recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five
                   kinds of state abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ
                   representation and MAXQ-Q through a series of experiments in
                   three domains and shows experimentally that MAXQ-Q (with
                   state abstractions) converges to a recursively optimal
                   policy much faster than flat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ

                   important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and
                   execute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure
                   similar to the policy improvement step of policy iteration.

                   non-hierarchical execution experimentally. Finally, the

              dynamic, human-occupied warehouses. The second is the robot's
              ability to learn the visual identity of an object from a single
              user-provided example and use the learned model to reliably and
              persistently detect objects despite significant spatial and
              temporal excursions. The third is a reliance on local sensing
              that allows the robot to handle variable palletized cargo and
              navigate within dynamic, minimally prepared environments without
              a global positioning system. The fourth concerns the robot's
              operation in close proximity to people, including its human
              supervisor, pedestrians who may cross or block its path, moving
              vehicles, and forklift operators who may climb inside the robot
              and operate it manually. This is made possible by interaction
              mechanisms that facilitate safe, effective operation around
              people. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the
              system's architecture and implementation, indicating how
              real-world operational requirements motivated key design choices.
              We offer qualitative and quantitative analyses of the robot
              operating in real settings and discuss the lessons learned from
              our effort.",

               landfall at Cape Romano, Florida. Three days later, the Center
               for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue at the University of South
               Florida deployed an iSENYS helicopter and a prototype unmanned
               water surface vehicle, AEOS-1, to survey damage in parts of
               Marco Island, 14 km from landfall. The effort was the first
               known use of unmanned sea surface vehicles (USVs) for emergency
               response and established their suitability for the recovery
               phase of disaster management by detecting damage to seawalls and
               piers, locating submerged debris (moorings and handrails), and
               determining safe lanes for sea navigation. It provides a
               preliminary domain theory of postdisaster port and littoral
               inspection with unmanned vehicles for use by the human--robot
               interaction community. It was also the first known demonstration
               of the strongly heterogeneous USV--micro aerial vehicle (MAV)
               team for any domain. The effort identified cooperative UAV--USV
               strategies and open issues for autonomous operations near
               structures. The effort showed that the MAV provided a
               much-needed external view for situation awareness and provided
               spotting for areas to be inspected. Concepts of operations for
               USV damage inspection and USV--MAV cooperation emerged,
               including a formula for computing the human--robot ratio: Nh =
               (2 $\times$ Nv) + 1, where Nh is the number of humans and Nv is
               the number of vehicles. The outstanding research issues span
               three areas: challenges for USVs operating near littoral
               structures, general issues for USV--MAV cooperation, and new

              analysis and design of joint human-robot teams. Each issue deals
              with a different aspect of the following question: how to best
              combine human and robot capabilities to accomplish some set of
              tasks? The first issue addressed here is that of predicting human
              supervisory control performance in large-scale networked teams of
              robots. It is shown that models based on individual operator
              characteristics such as working memory capacity can be used to
              probabilistically predict human supervisory control metrics under
              different operating conditions via linear regression, Bayesian
              network, and Gaussian process models. The second issue addressed
              here is that of modeling human supervisors of multi-robot teams
              as discrete strategic decision makers. A probabilistic
              discriminative modeling approach is presented here, and novel
              fully Bayesian learning techniques are presented and validated
              for identifying appropriate discriminative model parameters and
              model structures from experimental data. The third issue
              addressed here is that of combining useful information from human
              observations with information obtained from traditional robot
              sensors. A novel recursive Bayesian estimation framework is
              presented for fusing imprecise soft categorical human
              observations with robot sensor data via Gaussian and Gaussian
              mixture approximations. The proposed data fusion approach is
              validated in hardware with a real human-robot team on a

              data fusion system for localization of a mobile skid-steer robot
              intended for USAR missions. We exploit a rich sensor suite
              including both proprioceptive (inertial measurement unit and
              tracks odometry) and exteroceptive sensors (omnidirectional
              camera and rotating laser rangefinder). To cope with the
              specificities of each sensing modality (such as significantly
              differing sampling frequencies), we introduce a novel fusion
              scheme based on an extended Kalman filter for six degree of
              freedom orientation and position estimation. We demonstrate the
              performance on field tests of more than 4.4 km driven under
              standard USAR conditions. Part of our datasets include ground
              truth positioning, indoor with a Vicon motion capture system and
              outdoor with a Leica theodolite tracker. The overall median
              accuracy of localization---achieved by combining all four
              modalities---was 1.2\% and 1.4\% of the total distance traveled
              for indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. To identify
              the true limits of the proposed data fusion, we propose and
              employ a novel experimental evaluation procedure based on failure
              case scenarios. In this way, we address the common issues such as
              slippage, reduced camera field of view, and limited laser
              rangefinder range, together with moving obstacles spoiling the
              metric map. We believe such a characterization of the failure
              cases is a first step toward identifying the behavior of state
              estimation under such conditions. We release all our datasets to
              the robotics community for possible benchmarking.",

               inherent in the mapping problem. While statistical inference
               techniques have led to computationally efficient mapping
               algorithms, the next major challenge in robotic mapping is to
               automate the data collection process. In this paper, we address
               the problem of how a robot should plan to explore an unknown
               environment and collect data in order to maximize the accuracy
               of the resulting map. We formulate exploration as a constrained
               optimization problem and use reinforcement learning to find
               trajectories that lead to accurate maps. We demonstrate this
               process in simulation and show that the learned policy not only
               results in improved map building, but that the learned policy
               also transfers successfully to a real robot exploring on MIT

              reinforcement learning (RL) at a level easily understood by
              students and researchers in a wide range of disciplines. The
              intent is not to present a\textbackslashnrigorous mathematical
              discussion that requires a great deal of effort on the part of
              the reader, but rather to present a conceptual framework that
              might serve as an introduction to a more rigorous study of RL.
              The fundamental principles and techniques used to solve RL
              problems are presented. The most popular RL algorithms are
              presented. Section 1 presents an overview of RL and provides a
              simple example to develop intuition of the underlying dynamic
              programming mechanism. In Section 2 the parts of a reinforcement
              learning problem are discussed. These include the environment,
              reinforcement function, and value function. Section 3 gives a
              description of the most widely used reinforcement learning
              algorithms. These include TD($\lambda$) and both the residual and
              direct forms of value iteration, Q-learning, and advantage
              learning. In Section 4 some of the ancillary issues in RL are
              briefly discussed, such as choosing an exploration strategy and
              an appropriate discount factor. The conclusion is given in
              Section 5. Finally, Section 6 is a glossary of commonly used
              terms followed by references in Section 7 and a bibliography of
              RL applications in Section 8. The tutorial structure is such that

               function estimates such as neural networks do not possess this

               originally introduced to unveil new and innovative design
               principles in engineering design problems. The innovization
               procedure stretches beyond an optimization task and attempts to
               discover new design/operational rules/principles relating to
               decision variables and objectives, so that a deeper
               understanding of the underlying problem can be obtained. By
               integrating the concept of innovization with simulation and data

               for general systems analysis. The uniqueness of the approach

               from the multi-objective optimization using data mining are used
               to modify the original optimization. Hence, faster convergence
               to the desired solution of the decision-maker can be achieved.
               In other words, faster convergence and deeper knowledge of the
               relationships between the key decision variables and objectives
               can be obtained by interleaving the multi-objective optimization
               and data mining process. In this paper, such an interleaved

               article, a comprehensive review of existing kriging-based
               methods for the optimization of noisy functions is provided. In
               summary, ten methods for choosing the sequential samples are
               described using a unified formalism. They are compared on
               analytical benchmark problems, whereby the usual assumption of
               homoscedastic Gaussian noise made in the underlying models is
               meet. Different problem configurations (noise level, maximum
               number of observations, initial number of observations) and
               setups (covariance functions, budget, initial sample size) are
               considered. It is found that the choices of the initial sample
               size and the covariance function are not critical. The choice of
               the method, however, can result in significant differences in
               the performance. In particular, the three most intuitive
               criteria are found as poor alternatives. Although no criterion
               is found consistently more efficient than the others, two
               specialized methods appear more robust on average.",

               strategies for hyper-parameter optimiza- tion. This paper shows
               empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are
               more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a
               grid. Empirical evidence comes from a compar- ison with a large
               previous study that used grid search and manual search to
               configure neural net- works and deep belief networks. Compared
               with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find
               that random search over the same domain is able to find models
               that are as good or better within a small fraction of the
               computation time. Granting random search the same computational
               budget, random search finds better models by effectively
               searching a larger, less promising con- figuration space.
               Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful
               combination of manual search and grid search, purely random
               search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found
               statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and
               superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process
               analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set
               performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the
               hyper-parameters really matter, but that different
               hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This
               phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring
               algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on
               why recent ``High Throughput''methods achieve surprising
               success---they appear to search through a large number of
               hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter
               much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical
               models will place an increasing burden on techniques for
               hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that randomsearch

               proceeds by parameterising a covariance function, and then
               infers the parameters given the training data. In this thesis,
               the classical approach is augmented by interpreting Gaussian
               processes as the outputs of linear filters excited by white
               noise. This enables a straightforward definition of dependent
               Gaussian processes as the outputs of a multiple output linear
               filter excited by multiple noise sources. We show how dependent
               Gaussian processes defined in this way can also be used for the
               purposes of system identification. Onewell known
               problemwithGaussian process regression is that the compu-
               tational complexity scales poorlywith the amount of training
               data.We review one approximate solution that alleviates this
               problem, namely reduced rank Gaussian processes. We then show
               how the reduced rank approximation can be applied to allow for
               the efficient computation of dependent Gaussian pro- cesses. We
               then examine the application ofGaussian processes to the
               solution of other machine learning problems. To do so, we review
               methods for the parameter- isation of full covariance matrices.
               Furthermore, we discuss how improve- ments can be made by
               marginalising over alternative models, and introduce methods to
               perform these computations efficiently. In particular, we intro-

               arrives. Gaussian process regression can also be applied to
               optimisation. An algo- rithm is described that uses model
               comparison between multiple models to find the optimumof a
               function while taking as fewsamples as possible. This algorithm
               shows impressive performance on the standard control problem of
               double pole balancing. Finally, we describe how Gaussian

  abstract = "Engineers in many industries routinely need to improve the
              product or process designs using data from the field, lab
              experiments, and computer experiments. Historically, designers
              have performed a calibration exercise to ``fix'' the lab system
              or computer model and then used an analysis method or
              optimization procedure that ignores the fact that systematic
              differences between products in the field and other environments
              necessarily exist. A new line of research is not based on the
              assumption that calibration is perfect and seeks to develop
              experimental planning and optimization schemes using data form
              multiple experimental sources. We use the term ``fidelity'' to
              refer to the extent to which a surrogate experimental system can
              reproduce results of the system of interest. For experimental
              planning, we present perhaps the first optimal designs for
              variable fidelity experimentation, using an extension of the
              Expected Integrated Mean Squared Error (EIMSE) criterion, where
              the Generalized Least Squares (GLS) method was used to generate
              the predictions. Numerical tests are used to compare the method
              performance with alternatives and to investigate the robustness
              to incorporated assumptions. The method is applied to automotive
              engine valve heat treatment process design in which real world
              data were mixed with data from two types of computer simulations.
              Sequential Kriging Optimization (SKO) is a method developed in
              recent years for solving expensive black-box problems in areas
              such as large-scale circuit board design and manufacturing
              process improvement. We propose an extension of the SKO method,
              named Multiple Fidelity Sequential Kriging Optimization (MFSKO),
              where surrogate systems are exploited to reduce the total
              evaluation cost. As a pre-step to MFSKO, we extended SKO to
              address stochastic black-box systems. In the empirical studies
              using numerical test functions, SKO compared favorably with
              alternatives in terms of consistency in finding global optima and
              efficiency as measured by number of evaluations. Also, in the
              presence of noise, the new expected improvement function for
              infill sample selection appears to achieve the desired balance
              between the need for global and local searches. In the proposed
              MFSKO method, data on all experimental systems are integrated to
              build a kriging meta-model that provides a global prediction of
              the system of interest and a measure of prediction uncertainty.
              The location and fidelity level of the next evaluation are
              selected by maximizing an augmented expected improvement
              function, which is connected with the evaluation costs. The
              proposed method was applied to test functions from the literature
              and metal-forming process design problems via Finite Element
              simulations. The method manifests sensible search patterns,
              robust performance, and appreciable reduction in total evaluation
              cost as compared to the original method.",

                   predicted values of the latent wetland condition variable
                   produced by the model at each location do not hold any
                   intrinsic value, the relative magnitudes of the wetland
                   condition values are of interest. In addition, by including
                   point-referenced covariates in the model, we are able to
                   make predictions at new locations for both the latent random
                   variable and the multivariate response. Lastly, the model
                   produces ranks of the multivariate responses in relation to
                   the unobserved latent random field. This is an important
                   result as it allows us to determine which response variables
                   are most closely correlated with the latent variable. Our
                   approach offers an alternative to traditional indices based
                   on best professional judgment that are frequently used in
                   ecology. We apply our model to assess wetland condition in
                   the North Platte and Rio Grande River Basins in Colorado.
                   The model facilitates a comparison of wetland condition at
                   multiple locations and ranks the importance of in-field
                   measurements.",

                compare potential CIC out come of fighters. Based on this, the
                Dog-Fight-Metric (DFM) was formulated. DFM is a simple
                empirical metric that could be used to evaluate/ design CIC
                fighters. It emphasizes low wing-loading and high drag at
                moderate to high angles of attack. The use of this metric
                suggested that equal DFM could predict equal close- in-combat
                outcome. For example, the X-31 and the F-18 both flying at DFM
                25, had corresponding angles of attack of 43 and 35 degrees,
                respectively. It is concluded that dissimilar fighters could be
                made to have similar CIC outcome (equal DFM) when flown at
                different angles of attack. Conversely, two similar fighters

              analytically intractable in- tegral over the posterior
              distribution of the hyperparameters in Gaussian processes. The
              properties of the approximations are studied, and their
              performance is compared to each other and to a method using a
              point-estimate. Traditionally the integral over the posterior of
              the hyperparameters is computed using Markov chain Monte Carlo
              (MCMC) -methods. However, MCMC methods suffer from a heavy
              computational burden of Gaussian processes, because the
              complexity of Gaussian process models grows with the amount of
              the data used. An alternative approach has been to use only a
              point estimate for the hyperparameters instead of integrating
              over their posterior distribution. This is a computationally
              attractive approach, but it ignores the uncertainty related to
              the hyperparameters. The approximations discussed in this thesis
              attempt to take the uncertainty in the hyper- parameters into
              consideration better than does a point estimate method, and to be
              compu- tationally lighter than MCMC methods. The results
              demonstrate that the integration over the hyperparameters is
              beneficial in particular conditions. In addition, it is shown
              that a point estimate method yields equally accurate results with
              the integration methods in other situations. The amount of the
              data and the use of the models determine the need for the

               produce results that are not significantly different (at a 5\%
               level) with increased robustness (less variance in the mean

              black-box functions that are expensive to evaluate, non-convex,
              and possibly noisy. Recently, Bayesian optimization has been used
              with great effectiveness for applications like tuning the
              hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms and automatic A/B
              testing for websites. This thesis considers Bayesian optimization
              in the presence of black-box constraints. Prior work on
              constrained Bayesian optimization consists of a variety of
              methods that can be used with some efficacy in specific contexts.
              Here, by forming a connection with multi-task Bayesian
              optimization, we formulate a more general class of constrained
              Bayesian optimization problems that we call Bayesian optimization
              with decoupled constraints. In this general framework, the
              objective and constraint functions are divided into tasks that
              can be evaluated independently of each other, and resources with
              which these tasks can be performed. We then present two methods
              for solving problems in this general class. The first method, an
              extension to a constrained variant of expected improvement, is
              fast and straightforward to implement but performs poorly in some
              circumstances and is not sufficiently flexible to address all
              varieties of decoupled problems. The second method, Predictive
              Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC), is highly effective and
              sufficiently flexible to address all problems in the general
              class of decoupled problems without any ad hoc modifications. The
              two weaknesses of PESC are its implementation difficulty and slow
              execution time. We address these issues by, respectively,
              providing a publicly available implementation within the popular
              Bayesian optimization software Spearmint, and developing an
              extension to PESC that achieves greater speed without significant
              performance losses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these

                procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver
                for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), as well as

               of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process
               regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a

               point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between
               predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the
               evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on

  abstract  = "We present a new algorithm for finding the global minimum of a
               multivariate function subject to simple bounds. The algorithm is
               a modification of the standard Lipschitzian approach that
               eliminates the need to specify a Lipschitz constant. This is
               done by carrying out simultaneous searches using all possible
               constants from zero to infinity. On nine standard test
               functions, the new algorithm converges in fewer function
               evaluations than most competing methods.The motivation for the
               new algorithm stems from a different way of looking at the
               Lipschitz constant. In particular, the Lipschitz constant is
               viewed as a weighting parameter that indicates how much emphasis
               to place on global versus local search. In standard Lipschitzian
               methods, this constant is usually large because it must equal or
               exceed the maximum rate of change of the objective function. As
               a result, these methods place a high emphasis on global search
               and exhibit slow convergence. In contrast, the new algorithm
               carries out simultaneous searches using all possible constants,
               and therefore operates at both the global and local level. Once
               the global part of the algorithm finds the basin of convergence
               of the optimum, the local part of the algorithm quickly and
               automatically exploits it. This accounts for the fast

               methods that deal with multiple outputs. This has been motivated
               partly by frameworks like multitask learning, multisensor
               networks or structured output data. From a Gaussian processes
               perspective, the problem reduces to specifying an appropriate
               covariance function that, whilst being positive semi-definite,
               captures the dependencies between all the data points and across
               all the outputs. One approach to account for non-trivial
               correlations between outputs employs convolution processes.
               Under a latent function interpretation of the convolution
               transform we establish dependencies between output variables.
               The main drawbacks of this approach are the associated
               computational and storage demands. In this paper we address
               these issues. We present different efficient approximations for
               dependent output Gaussian processes constructed through the
               convolution formalism. We exploit the conditional independencies
               present naturally in the model. This leads to a form of the

               correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical
               to realizing a method's full potential. Compounding matters,
               these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is
               applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself
               often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that
               are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a
               given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the
               algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes
               difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better,
               or simply better tuned. In this work, we propose a meta-modeling
               approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with
               the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning
               with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our
               approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a
               performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation
               examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only
               how individual processing steps are applied, but even which
               processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization
               algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing
               that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art
               results on three disparate computer vision problems: a
               face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification
               task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using

                   maker plays a complex action rather than a basic arm in each
                   round. The reward of the complex action is some function of
                   the basic arms' rewards, and the feedback observed may not
                   necessarily be the reward per-arm. For instance, when the
                   complex actions are subsets of the arms, we may only observe
                   the maximum reward over the chosen subset. Thus, feedback
                   across complex actions may be coupled due to the nature of
                   the reward function. We prove a frequentist regret bound for
                   Thompson sampling in a very general setting involving
                   parameter, action and observation spaces and a likelihood

              evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems
              pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization,
              since existing methods often require more function evaluations
              than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this
              challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by
              evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few
              points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization,
              tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce
              the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially
              good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often
              occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating

              it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by
              sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this

              kappa-cv considering its sources of variance: sensitivity to
              changes in the training set and sensitivity to changes in the
              folds. The paper also compares the bias and variance of the
              estimator for different values of kappa. The experimental study
              has been performed in artificial domains because they allow the
              exact computation of the implied quantities and we can rigorously
              specify the conditions of experimentation. The experimentation
              has been performed for two classifiers (naive Bayes and nearest
              neighbor), different numbers of folds, sample sizes, and training
              sets coming from assorted probability distributions. We conclude
              by including some practical recommendation on the use of

               Improvements in computational power, recent reductions in the
               (computational) cost of classification algorithms, and the
               development of closed-form solutions (for performing cross

  abstract = "We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to
              approximation schemes that are equivalent to networks with one
              layer of hidden units, called regularization networks. In
              particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of
              regularization networks, the well known radial basis functions
              approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization
              networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes,
              including many of the popular general additive models and some of
              the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of
              smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis
              functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product
              splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness
              functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends
              radial basis functions (RBF) to hyper basis functions (HBF) also
              leads from additive models to ridge approximation models,
              containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms
              of projection pursuit regression, and several types of neural
              networks. We propose to use the term generalized regularization
              networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that
              follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic
              interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis
              functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities
              on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different
              types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer
              networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call
              generalized regularization networks, correspond to different
              classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a

              radial basis functions that can be generalized to hyper basis
              functions, (2) some tensor product splines, and (3) additive
              splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge

               properties that define your current self are preserved in the
               person you will be in the future---helps motivate consumers to
               make far-sighted choices by changing their valuation of future
               outcomes (e.g., discount factors). However, this change only
               reduces spending when opportunity costs are considered.
               Correspondingly, cues that highlight opportunity costs reduce
               spending primarily when people discount the future less or are

  abstract = "The recent development of various methods of modulation such as
              PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio
              has intensified the interest in a general theory of
              communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the
              important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the
              present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of
              new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel,
              and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the
              original message and due to the nature of the final destination
              of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is
              that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately
              a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have
              meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to
              some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These
              semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the
              engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual
              message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The
              system must be designed to operate for each possible selection,
              not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is
              unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the
              set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this
              number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced
              when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being
              equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural
              choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must
              be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the
              statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of
              messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic

               generally applicable irrespective of the application,
               uncertainty representation, reasoning scheme or data format.
               Since the URREF ontology is still an evolving framework, it is
               the focus of ongoing refinement through the efforts of the
               Evaluation of Techniques for Uncertainty Representation Working
               Group (ETURWG). Recent efforts by the authors to apply the URREF

               systems have identified a need to translate and map the
               terminology of the URREF to the Bayesian network paradigm. The
               BN-to-URREF mapping is addressed in this paper within the
               context of the atomic decision procedure (ADP) and the latest
               view of the URREF ontology. The atomic decision procedure
               describes the information fusion process from input to output

               and processing of this information and the qualification of the

               with this uncertain information (ADP-3) and finally the decision
               scheme and output information (ADP-4). The URREF evaluation of
               the BN information fusion process allows for evaluation

  abstract = "This article describes an extension of classical $\chi$2
              goodness-of-fit tests to Bayesian model assessment. The
              extension, which essentially involves evaluating Pearson's
              goodness-of-fit statistic at a parameter value drawn from its
              posterior distribution, has the important property that it is
              asymptotically distributed as a $\chi$2 random variable on K−1
              degrees of freedom, independently of the dimension of the
              underlying parameter vector. By examining the posterior
              distribution of this statistic, global goodness-of-fit
              diagnostics are obtained. Advantages of these diagnostics include
              ease of interpretation, computational convenience and favorable
              power properties. The proposed diagnostics can be used to assess
              the adequacy of a broad class of Bayesian models, essentially

  abstract  = "Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex
               hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not
               clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we
               derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a
               model as the difference between the posterior mean of the
               deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the
               parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds
               to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the
               posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the
               `hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its
               properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior
               mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or
               adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to
               the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of
               deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior
               mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for
               comparing models, which is related to other information criteria
               and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The
               procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are

  title    = "The Elements of Statistical Learning",
  author   = "Hastie, Trevor and Tibshirani, Robert and Friedman, Jerome",
  abstract = "During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation
              and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data
              in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and
              marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to
              the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and
              spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and
              bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but
              are often expressed with different terminology. This book
              describes the important ideas in these areas in a common
              conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the
              emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples
              are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a
              valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data
              mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from
              supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The
              many topics include neural networks, support vector machines,
              classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive
              treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert
              Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at
              Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area:
              Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and
              wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the
              statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal
              curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is
              co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the
              Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools
              including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS:
              TECHNOMETRICS ``This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it
              concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather
              than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations
              are principle features...As a source for the methods of
              statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before
              there is a competitor to this book.''",

                     areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational
                     approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize
                     the total amount of reward it receives when interacting
                     with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement
                     Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear
                     and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of
                     reinforcement learning. Their discussion ranges from the
                     history of the field's intellectual foundations to the
                     most recent developments and applications. The only

  abstract  = "Multi-armed bandit problems are the most basic examples of
               sequential decision problems with an exploration-exploitation
               trade-off. This is the balance between staying with the option
               that gave highest payoffs in the past and exploring new options
               that might give higher payoffs in the future. Although the study
               of bandit problems dates back to the Thirties,
               exploration-exploitation trade-offs arise in several modern
               applications, such as ad placement, website optimization, and
               packet routing. Mathematically, a multi-armed bandit is defined
               by the payoff process associated with each option. In this
               survey, we focus on two extreme cases in which the analysis of
               regret is particularly simple and elegant: i.i.d. payoffs and

               exaggeration. But in spirit, the title is apt, as the book does
               cover a much broader range of topics than a typical introductory
               book on mathematical statistics. This book is for people who
               want to learn probability and statistics quickly. It is suitable
               for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in computer
               science, mathematics, statistics, and related disciplines. The
               book includes modern topics like nonparametric curve estimation,
               bootstrapping, and clas sification, topics that are usually
               relegated to follow-up courses. The reader is presumed to know
               calculus and a little linear algebra. No previous knowledge of
               probability and statistics is required. Statistics, data mining,
               and machine learning are all concerned with collecting and
               analyzing data. For some time, statistics research was con
               ducted in statistics departments while data mining and machine
               learning re search was conducted in computer science
               departments. Statisticians thought that computer scientists were
               reinventing the wheel. Computer scientists thought that
               statistical theory didn't apply to their problems. Things are
               changing. Statisticians now recognize that computer scientists
               are making novel contributions while computer scientists now
               recognize the generality of statistical theory and methodology.
               Clever data mining algo rithms are more scalable than
               statisticians ever thought possible. Formal sta tistical theory

               neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook
               introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information
               theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such
               as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes
               for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques,
               including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and
               variational approximations, are developed alongside applications
               of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent
               component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the
               book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes,

              abstraction in reinforcement learning",
  author   = "Sutton, Richard S and Precup, Doina and Singh, Satinder",
  abstract = "Learning, planning, and representing knowledge at multiple levels
              of temporal abstraction are key, longstanding challenges for AI.
              In this paper we consider how these challenges can be addressed
              within the mathematical framework of reinforcement learning and
              Markov decision processes (MDPs). We extend the usual notion of
              action in this framework to include options---closed-loop
              policies for taking action over a period of time. Examples of
              options include picking up an object, going to lunch, and
              traveling to a distant city, as well as primitive actions such as
              muscle twitches and joint torques. Overall, we show that options
              enable temporally abstract knowledge and action to be included in
              the reinforcement learning framework in a natural and general
              way. In particular, we show that options may be used
              interchangeably with primitive actions in planning methods such
              as dynamic programming and in learning methods such as
              Q-learning. Formally, a set of options defined over an MDP
              constitutes a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP), and the theory
              of SMDPs provides the foundation for the theory of options.
              However, the most interesting issues concern the interplay
              between the underlying MDP and the SMDP and are thus beyond SMDP
              theory. We present results for three such cases: (1) we show that
              the results of planning with options can be used during execution
              to interrupt options and thereby perform even better than
              planned, (2) we introduce new intra-option methods that are able
              to learn about an option from fragments of its execution, and (3)
              we propose a notion of subgoal that can be used to improve the
              options themselves. All of these results have precursors in the
              existing literature; the contribution of this paper is to
              establish them in a simpler and more general setting with fewer
              changes to the existing reinforcement learning framework. In
              particular, we show that these results can be obtained without
              committing to (or ruling out) any particular approach to state
              abstraction, hierarchy, function approximation, or the
              macro-utility problem.",

               target attack capability, to N hostile fighters called targets
               to achieve an optimal missile-target attack effect. Thus,
               Missile-Target Assignment (MTA) is regarded as the main part of
               the DM problem and has to be solved firstly. Then, the DM
               solution is derived from the optimal MTA solution. To the MTA
               problem, a Heuristic Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (HAGA) is
               proposed to search for its optimal solution. The HAGA utilizes
               specific heuristic knowledge to improve the search capability of
               the Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA). Simulation results show
               that the HAGA is effective and has much better performance than
               the AGA.",

                their skills against another team, controlled by humans or by
                the computer. Most players prefer human opponents, since the
                artificial intelligence of a computer-controlled team is in
                general inferior. An adaptive mechanism for team-oriented
                artificial intelligence would allow computer-controlled
                opponents to adapt to human player behaviour, thereby providing
                a means of dealing with weaknesses in the game AI. Current
                commercial computer games lack challenging adaptive mechanisms.
                This paper proposes ``TEAM'', a novel team-oriented adaptive
                mechanism which is inspired by evolutionary algorithms. The
                performance of TEAM is evaluated in an experiment involving an
                actual commercial computer game (the Capture The Flag
                team-based game mode of the popular commercial computer game
                Quake III). The experimental results indicate that TEAM
                succeeds in endowing computer-controlled opponents with
                successful adaptive performance. We therefore conclude that

              to game developers and players. Choosing a proper set of
              parameters in a multiplayer game is not a straightforward process
              because consideration must be given to a large number of
              parameters, and therefore requires effort and thorough knowledge
              of the game. Thus, numerous artificial intelligence (AI)
              techniques are applied in the designing of game characters'
              behaviors. This study applied a genetic algorithm to evolve a
              team in the mode of One Flag CTF in Quake III Arena to behave
              intelligently. The source code of the team AI is modified, and
              the progress of the game is represented as a finite state
              machine. A fitness function is used to evaluate the effect of a
              team's tactics in certain circumstances during the game. The team
              as a whole evolves intelligently, and consequently, effective
              strategies are discovered and applied in various situations. The
              experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed

               health issues: the linkage between nitrate and (i) infant
               methaemoglobinaemia, also known as blue baby syndrome, and (ii)
               cancers of the digestive tract. The evidence for nitrate as a
               cause of these serious diseases remains controversial. On one
               hand there is evidence that shows there is no clear association
               between nitrate in drinking water and the two main health issues
               with which it has been linked, and there is even evidence
               emerging of a possible benefit of nitrate in cardiovascular
               health. There is also evidence of nitrate intake giving
               protection against infections such as gastroenteritis. Some

               the development of cancers in the digestive system. Given the

  abstract = "This work covers several aspects of the optimism in the face of
              uncertainty principle applied to large scale optimization
              problems under finite numerical budget. The initial motivation
              for the research reported here originated from the empirical
              success of the so-called Monte-Carlo Tree Search method
              popularized in computer-go and further extended to many other
              games as well as optimization and planning problems. Our
              objective is to contribute to the development of theoretical
              foundations of the field by characterizing the complexity of the
              underlying optimization problems and designing efficient
              algorithms with performance guarantees. The main idea presented
              here is that it is possible to decompose a complex decision
              making problem (such as an optimization problem in a large search
              space) into a sequence of elementary decisions, where each
              decision of the sequence is solved using a (stochastic)
              multi-armed bandit (simple mathematical model for decision making
              in stochastic environments). This so-called hierarchical bandit
              approach (where the reward observed by a bandit in the hierarchy
              is itself the return of another bandit at a deeper level)
              possesses the nice feature of starting the exploration by a
              quasi-uniform sampling of the space and then focusing
              progressively on the most promising area, at different scales,
              according to the evaluations observed so far, and eventually
              performing a local search around the global optima of the
              function. The performance of the method is assessed in terms of
              the optimality of the returned solution as a function of the
              number of function evaluations. Our main contribution to the
              field of function optimization is a class of hierarchical
              optimistic algorithms designed for general search spaces (such as
              metric spaces, trees, graphs, Euclidean spaces, ...) with
              different algorithmic instantiations depending on whether the
              evaluations are noisy or noiseless and whether some measure of
              the ''smoothness'' of the function is known or unknown. The
              performance of the algorithms depend on the local behavior of the
              function around its global optima expressed in terms of the
              quantity of near-optimal states measured with some metric. If
              this local smoothness of the function is known then one can
              design very efficient optimization algorithms (with convergence
              rate independent of the space dimension), and when it is not
              known, we can build adaptive techniques that can, in some cases,
              perform almost as well as when it is known.",

  abstract = "Abstract Player Modelling has been receiving much attention from
              the game community in the recent years. The ability to build
              accurate models of player behavior can be useful in many aspects
              of a game. One important aspect is the tracking of a player's
              behavior along time, informing every time a change is perceived.
              This way, the game Artificial Intelligence can adapt itself to
              better respond to this new behavior. In order to build models of
              player behavior, researchers frequently resort to Machine
              Learning techniques. Such methods work on previously recorded
              game metrics representing player's interactions with the game
              environment. However, if the player changes styles over time, the
              constructed models get out of date. In order to address this
              drawback, this work proposes the use of and incremental learning
              technique to track a player's behavior during his/her interaction
              with the game environment. Our approach attempts to automatically
              detect the moments in time when the player changes behavior. We
              apply a change detection technique from the area of Data Stream
              Mining that is based on incremental clustering and novelty
              detection. We also propose three modifications to the original
              technique, in order to formalize change detection, improve
              detection rate and reduce detection delay. Simulations were
              performed considering data produced by the Unreal Tournament
              game, showing the applicability of the method to online tracking

              ``playware'' physical interactive platform is demonstrated in
              this paper. Previously constructed artificial neural network user
              models, reported in the literature, map individual playing
              characteristics to reported entertainment preferences for
              augmented-reality game players. An adaptive mechanism then
              adjusts controllable game parameters in real time in order to
              improve the entertainment value of the game for the player. The
              basic approach presented here applies gradient ascent to the user
              model to suggest the direction of parameter adjustment that leads
              toward games of higher entertainment value. A simple rule set
              exploits the derivative information to adjust specific game
              parameters to augment the entertainment value. Those adjustments
              take place frequently during the game with interadjustment
              intervals that maintain the user model's accuracy. Performance of
              the adaptation mechanism is evaluated using a game survey
              experiment. Results indicate the efficacy and robustness of the
              mechanism in adapting the game according to a user's individual
              playing features and enhancing the gameplay experience. The
              limitations and the use of the methodology as an effective

              dataset used in this research represents the largest DMO

              improvements from the numerous measured skill metrics (e.g.,
              weapons employment), SME expert observer ratings, and participant
              self-report opinion ratings. These converging results provide
              substantial evidence that pilots become much more proficient on

              trials to learn effective behavior (i.e., game adaptation is not
              rapid). In addition, game developers are concerned that applying
              adaptive game AI may result in uncontrollable and unpredictable
              behavior (i.e., game adaptation is not reliable). These
              characteristics hamper the incorporation of adaptive game AI in
              commercially available video games. In this paper, we discuss an
              alternative to these current approaches. Our alternative approach
              to adaptive game AI has as its goal adapting rapidly and reliably
              to game circumstances. Our approach can be classified in the area
              of case-based adaptive game AI. In the approach, domain knowledge
              required to adapt to game circumstances is gathered automatically
              by the game AI, and is exploited immediately (i.e., without
              trials and without resource-intensive learning) to evoke
              effective behavior in a controlled manner in online play. We
              performed experiments that test case-based adaptive game AI on
              three different maps in a commercial real-time strategy (RTS)

               information from multiple sensors that provide their measurement
               updates according to separate event-triggering conditions. An
               optimal sensor fusion problem based on the hybrid measurement
               information (namely, point- and set-valued measurements) is
               formulated and explored. We show that under a commonly-accepted
               Gaussian assumption, the optimal estimator depends on the
               conditional mean and covariance of the measurement innovations,
               which applies to general event-triggering schemes. For the case
               that each channel of the sensors has its own event-triggering
               condition, closed-form representations are derived for the
               optimal estimate and the corresponding error covariance matrix,
               and it is proved that the exploration of the set-valued
               information provided by the event-triggering sets guarantees the
               improvement of estimation performance. The effectiveness of the
               proposed event-based estimator is demonstrated by extensive

              existence of an unobserved weather state, which serves as a link
              between the large-scale atmospheric measures and the small-scale
              spatially discontinuous precipitation field. The weather state
              effectively acts as an automatic classifier of atmospheric
              patterns. The weather state process is assumed to be
              conditionally Markov, given the atmospheric data. The rainfall
              process is then assumed to be conditionally independent given the
              weather state. Various parameterizations for the weather state
              process and the rainfall process are discussed, and a

              estimates of the storm duration distribution and first and second

               does not determine the transition probabilities for the true or
               underlying CD4 cell counts; the measurements error results in a
               process that is too rough. Assuming independent measurement
               errors, we propose a likelihood-based method for estimating the
               'true' or underlying transition probabilities. The Markov
               structure allows efficient calculation of the likelihood by
               using hidden Markov model methodology. As example, we consider
               CD4 cell count data from 430 HIV-infected participants in the
               San Francisco Men's Health Study by categorizing the marker data
               into seven stages; up to 17 observations are available for each
               individual. We find that including measurement error both
               produces a significantly better fit and provides a model for CD4
               progression that is more biologically reasonable.",

  abstract = "Automation is often problematic because people fail to rely upon
              it appropriately. Because people respond to technology socially,
              trust influences reliance on automation. In particular, trust
              guides reliance when complexity and unanticipated situations make
              a complete understanding of the automation impractical. This
              review considers trust from the organizational, sociological,
              interpersonal, psychological, and neurological perspectives. It
              considers how the context, automation characteristics, and
              cognitive processes affect the appropriateness of trust. The
              context in which the automation is used influences automation
              performance and provides a goal-oriented perspective to assess
              automation characteristics along a dimension of attributional
              abstraction. These characteristics can influence trust through
              analytic, analogical, and affective processes. The challenges of
              extrapolating the concept of trust in people to trust in
              automation are discussed. A conceptual model integrates research
              regarding trust in automation and describes the dynamics of
              trust, the role of context, and the influence of display

              ion channels, infectious disease processes, and rainfall
              occurrence. Since the late 1960's, however, it has been
              appreciated that even the seemingly mundane task of calculating
              the log-likelihood of hidden Markov models is not a trivial
              matter. This task, known as the evaluation problem, was addressed
              through the development of an early example of the
              Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In this thesis, the problem
              of evaluation is addressed along both quantitative and
              qualitative lines. Quantitatively, and efficient algorithm is
              developed for fast computation of the log-likelihood, the score,
              and the observed information matrix from a single pass through
              the data. This enables one to readily obtain standard errors of
              parameter estimates, something that is rarely achieved in most
              typical EM stettings. It also permits alternatie maximization
              techniques to the EM algorithm. Qualitatively, sound goodnes sof
              fit technniques based on an expansion of the score are developed
              that are consistent against a wide variety of model
              mis-specifications. These techniques are shown to have good power
              in a range of situations, and may be performed with relatively
              little ocmputational effort. A complementary goodness of fit
              method based on conditional residuals is also developed that
              enables one to effectively screen a wide variety of candidate
              predictor variables without requiring additional refitting of the
              model. The methods are evaluated through both simulations and

               level instead provides greater flexibility for application
               domains not envisioned by the language designer. Only a few
               languages, such as C++ and Haskell, provide the necessary power
               to define n-dimensional arrays, but these systems rely on

                 series",
  author      = "Cyrus Maher, M and Hernandez, Ryan D",
  abstract    = "Background: Establishing health-related causal relationships
                 is a central pursuit in biomedical research. Yet, the
                 interdependent non-linearity of biological systems renders
                 causal dynamics laborious and at times impractical to
                 disentangle. This pursuit is further impeded by the dearth of
                 time series that are sufficiently long to observe and
                 understand recurrent patterns of flux. However, as data
                 generation costs plummet and technologies like wearable
                 devices democratize data collection, we anticipate a coming
                 surge in the availability of biomedically-relevant time series
                 data. Given the life-saving potential of these burgeoning
                 resources, it is critical to invest in the development of open
                 source software tools that are capable of drawing meaningful
                 insight from vast amounts of time series data.Results: Here we
                 present CauseMap, the first open source implementation of
                 convergent cross mapping (CCM), a method for establishing
                 causality from long time series data (> ~25 observations).
                 Compared to existing time series methods, CCM has the
                 advantage of being model-free and robust to unmeasured
                 confounding that could otherwise induce spurious associations.
                 CCM builds on Takens' Theorem, a well-established result from
                 dynamical systems theory that requires only mild assumptions.
                 This theorem allows us to reconstruct high dimensional system
                 dynamics using a time series of only a single variable. These
                 reconstructions can be thought of as shadows of the true
                 causal system. If the reconstructed shadows can predict points
                 from the opposing time series, we can infer that the
                 corresponding variables are providing views of the same causal
                 system, and so are causally related. Unlike traditional
                 metrics, this test can establish the directionality of
                 causation, even in the presence of feedback loops.
                 Furthermore, since CCM can extract causal relationships from
                 times series of, e.g. a single individual, it may be a
                 valuable tool to personalized medicine. We implement CCM in
                 Julia, a high-performance programming language designed for
                 facile technical computing. Our software package, CauseMap, is
                 platform-independent and freely available as an official Julia
                 package.Conclusions: CauseMap is an efficient implementation
                 of a state-of-the-art algorithm for detecting causality from
                 time series data. We believe this tool will be a valuable

  author   = "van der Meulen, Frank and Schauer, Moritz",
  abstract = "Bayesian estimation of parameters of a diffusion based on
              discrete time observations poses a difficult problem due to the
              lack of a closed form expression for the likelihood.
              Data-augmentation has been proposed for obtaining draws from the
              posterior distribution of the parameters. Within this approach,
              the discrete time observations are augmented with diffusion
              bridges connecting these observations. This poses two challenges:
              (i) efficiently generating diffusion bridges; (ii) if unknown
              parameters appear in the diffusion coefficient, then direct
              implementation of data-augmentation results in an induced Markov
              chain which is reducible. In this paper we show how both
              challenges can be addressed in continuous time (before
              discretisation) by using guided proposals. These are Markov
              processes with dynamics described by the stochastic differential
              equation of the diffusion process with an additional term added
              to the drift coefficient to guide the process to hit the right
              end point of the bridge. The form of these proposals naturally
              provides a mapping that decouples the dependence between the
              diffusion coefficient and diffusion bridge using the driving
              Brownian motion of the proposals. As the guiding term has a
              singularity at the right end point, care is needed when
              discretisation is applied for implementation purposes. We show
              that this problem can be dealt with by appropriately time
              changing and scaling of the guided proposal process. In two
              examples we illustrate the performance of the algorithms we
              propose. The second of these concerns a diffusion approximation
              of a chemical reaction network with a four-dimensional diffusion
              driven by an eight-dimensional Brownian motion.",

  abstract = "In the course of evolution, proteins show a remarkable
              conservation of their three-dimensional structure and their
              biological function, leading to strong evolutionary constraints
              on the sequence variability between homologous proteins. Our
              method aims at extracting such constraints from rapidly
              accumulating sequence data, and thereby at inferring protein
              structure and function from sequence information alone. Recently,
              global statistical inference methods (e.g. direct-coupling
              analysis, sparse inverse covariance estimation) have achieved a
              breakthrough towards this aim, and their predictions have been
              successfully implemented into tertiary and quaternary protein
              structure prediction methods. However, due to the discrete nature
              of the underlying variable (amino-acids), exact inference
              requires exponential time in the protein length, and efficient
              approximations are needed for practical applicability. Here we
              propose a very efficient multivariate Gaussian modeling approach
              as a variant of direct-coupling analysis: the discrete amino-acid
              variables are replaced by continuous Gaussian random variables.
              The resulting statistical inference problem is efficiently and
              exactly solvable. We show that the quality of inference is
              comparable or superior to the one achieved by mean-field
              approximations to inference with discrete variables, as done by
              direct-coupling analysis. This is true for (i) the prediction of
              residue-residue contacts in proteins, and (ii) the identification
              of protein-protein interaction partner in bacterial signal
              transduction. An implementation of our multivariate Gaussian

               problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs).
               Multiscale problems are problems where the coefficients of a PDE
               oscillate rapidly on a microscopic length scale, but solutions
               are sought on a much larger, macroscopic domain. Solving
               multiscale problems requires both a theoretic result, i.e., a
               homogenization result yielding effective coefficients, as well
               as numerical solutions of the PDE at the microscopic and the
               macroscopic length scales. Numerical homogenization of PDEs with
               stochastic coefficients is especially computationally expensive.
               Under certain assumptions, effective coefficients can be found,
               but their calculation involves subtle numerical problems. The
               computational cost is huge due to the generally large number of
               stochastic dimensions. Multiscale problems arise in many
               applications, e.g., in uncertainty quantification, in the
               rational design of nanoscale sensors, and in the rational design
               of materials. Our code for the numerical stochastic
               homogenization of elliptic problems is implemented in Julia.
               Since multiscale problems pose new numerical problems, it is in
               any case necessary to develop new numerical codes. Julia is a
               dynamic language inspired by the Lisp family of languages, it is

              programmer's productivity at the same high level as if he would
              use Julia without a GPU. Indeed, very specialized and detailed
              technical knowledge is needed in order to program a GPU, making
              it complex and time-consuming. In many modern scientific domains
              quite a lot of brute computing power is required, but often these
              domains lack the technical expertise to use GPUs in an efficient
              manner. The purpose of this thesis is to provide access to a GPU
              from Julia in a way that shields the GPU details from the

              Julia was designed to be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia
              shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied
              community: 1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some
              sort of law of nature. 2. It is sensible to prototype in one
              language and then recode in another language. 3. There are parts
              of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left
              untouched as they are built by the experts. Julia began with a
              deep understanding of the needs of the scientific programmer and
              the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have
              often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer
              science and computational science creating a new approach to
              scientific computing. This note introduces the programmer to the
              language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader
              to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing
              systems. In particular, there is the fascinating dance between
              specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom
              treatment. We can pick just the right algorithm for the right
              circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument
              types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction
              recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped
              away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction
              allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that
              yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this
              interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine

              While there have been many successes for BO in low dimen-sions,
              scaling it to high dimensions has been no-toriously difficult.
              Existing literature on the topic are under very restrictive

              endeavour. We tackle these challenges by assuming an addi-tive
              structure for the function. This setting is sub-stantially more
              expressive and contains a richer class of functions than previous
              work. We prove that, for additive functions the regret has only
              lin-ear dependence on D even though the function depends on all D
              dimensions. We also demon-strate several other statistical and
              computational benefits in our framework. Via synthetic exam-ples,
              a scientific simulation and a face detection problem we

  abstract = "Robot configuration design is hampered by the lack of
              established, well-known design rules, and designers cannot easily
              grasp the space of possible designs and the im- pact of all
              design variables on a robots performance. Realistically, a human
              can only de- sign and evaluate several candidate configurations,
              though there may be thousands of competitive designs that should
              be investigated. In contrast, an automated approach to
              configuration synthesis can create tens of thousands of designs
              and measure the perfor- mance of each one without relying on
              previous experience or design rules. This thesis creates
              Darwin2K, an extensible, automated system for robot configu-
              ration synthesis. This research focuses on the development of
              synthesis capabilities re- quired for many robot design problems:
              a flexible and effective synthesis algorithm, useful simulation
              capabilities, appropriate representation of robots and their
              properties, and the ability to accomodate application-specific
              synthesis needs. Darwin2K can synthe- size and optimize
              kinematics, dynamics, structural geometry, actuator selection,
              and task and control parameters for a wide range of robots.
              Darwin2K uses an evolutionary algorithm to synthesize robots, and
              utilizes two new multi-objective selection procedures that are
              applicable to other evolutionary design domains. The evolutionary
              algorithm can effectively optimize multiple performance ob-
              jectives while satisfying multiple performance constraints, and
              can generate a range of so- lutions representing different
              trade-offs between objectives. Darwin2K uses a novel
              representation for robot configurations called the parameterized
              module configuration graph, enabling efficient and extensible
              synthesis of mobile robots, of single, multiple and bifurcating
              manipulators, and of robots with either modular or monolithic
              construction. Task-specific simulation is used to provide the
              synthesis algorithm with perfor- mance measurements for each
              robot. Darwin2K can automatically derive dynamic equa- tions for
              each robot it simulates, enabling dynamic simulation to be used
              during synthesis for the first time. Darwin2K also includes a
              variety of simulation components, including Jacobian and PID
              controllers, algorithms for estimating link deflection and for
              detecting collisions; modules for robot links, joints (including
              actuator models), tools, and bases (fixed and mobile); and
              metrics such as task coverage, task completion time, end effector
              error, actuator saturation, and link deflection. A significant
              component of the system is its extensible object-oriented
              software architecture, which allows new simulation capabili- ties
              and robot modules to be added without impacting the synthesis
              algorithm. The ar- chitecture also encourages re-use of existing
              toolkit components, allowing task-specific simulators to be
              quickly constructed. Darwin2Ks synthesis algorithm, simulation
              capabilities, and extensible architec- ture combine to allow
              synthesis of robots for a wide range of tasks. Results are
              presented for nearly 150 synthesis experiments for six different
              applications, including synthesis of a free-flying 22-DOF robot
              with multiple manipulators and a walking machine for zero-
              gravity truss walking. The synthesis system and results represent

                   human populated environments. A desirable capability of
                   these agents is to respond to goal-oriented commands by
                   autonomously constructing task plans. However, such autonomy
                   can add significant cognitive load and potentially introduce
                   safety risks to humans when agents behave unexpectedly.
                   Hence, for such agents to be helpful, one important
                   requirement is for them to synthesize plans that can be
                   easily understood by humans. While there exists previous
                   work that studied socially acceptable robots that interact
                   with humans in ``natural ways'', and work that investigated
                   legible motion planning, there lacks a general solution for
                   high level task planning. To address this issue, we
                   introduce the notions of plan \{\textbackslashit
                   explicability\} and \{\textbackslashit predictability\}. To
                   compute these measures, first, we postulate that humans
                   understand agent plans by associating abstract tasks with
                   agent actions, which can be considered as a labeling
                   process. We learn the labeling scheme of humans for agent
                   plans from training examples using conditional random fields
                   (CRFs). Then, we use the learned model to label a new plan
                   to compute its explicability and predictability. These
                   measures can be used by agents to proactively choose or
                   directly synthesize plans that are more explicable and
                   predictable to humans. We provide evaluations on a synthetic
                   domain and with human subjects using physical robots to show

                   which will interact with each other, with and/or without
                   knowledge of the computer's brain. When a learning algorithm
                   interacts, it does so by detecting and understanding the
                   entities in the human algorithm. However, the problem with
                   this approach is that the algorithm does not consider the
                   interaction of the third party or unknown entities, which
                   may be interacting with each other. These unknown entities
                   in their interaction with the non-computer entities make an
                   effect in the environment that influences the information
                   and the behaviour of the computer brain. Such details and
                   the ability to process the dynamic and unsettling nature of
                   these interactions are absent in the current learning

                   IBSEAD is able to evaluate and consider such algorithms and
                   thus give us a better accuracy in simulation of the highly
                   evolved nature of the human brain. Processes such as dreams,
                   imagination and novelty, that exist in humans are not fully

                   fails to consider the case of unknown entities which maybe

                   highly structured models whose parameters have a direct
                   psychological interpretation and highly complex,
                   general-purpose models whose parameters and representations
                   are difficult to interpret. The former typically provide
                   more insight into cognition but the latter often perform
                   better. This tension has recently surfaced in the realm of
                   educational data mining, where a deep learning approach to
                   predicting students' performance as they work through a
                   series of exercises---termed deep knowledge tracing or
                   DKT---has demonstrated a stunning performance advantage over
                   the mainstay of the field, Bayesian knowledge tracing or
                   BKT. In this article, we attempt to understand the basis for
                   DKT's advantage by considering the sources of statistical
                   regularity in the data that DKT can leverage but which BKT
                   cannot. We hypothesize four forms of regularity that BKT
                   fails to exploit: recency effects, the contextualized trial
                   sequence, inter-skill similarity, and individual variation
                   in ability. We demonstrate that when BKT is extended to
                   allow it more flexibility in modeling statistical
                   regularities---using extensions previously proposed in the
                   literature---BKT achieves a level of performance
                   indistinguishable from that of DKT. We argue that while DKT
                   is a powerful, useful, general-purpose framework for
                   modeling student learning, its gains do not come from the
                   discovery of novel representations---the fundamental
                   advantage of deep learning. To answer the question posed in
                   our title, knowledge tracing may be a domain that does not
                   require `depth'; shallow models like BKT can perform just as
                   well and offer us greater interpretability and explanatory

                   (SOC) theory. The approach consists of a centralized
                   high-level planner that computes optimal state trajectories
                   as velocity sequences, and a platform-specific low-level
                   controller which ensures that these velocity sequences are
                   met. The planning task is expressed as a centralized
                   path-integral control problem, for which optimal control
                   computation corresponds to a probabilistic inference problem
                   that can be solved by efficient sampling methods. Through

               goals of applications are and if they are meeting them, b)
               deciding what actions to take to help applications meet their
               goals, and c) developing standard techniques that generalize and
               can be applied to a broad range of self-aware systems. This work
               presents our vision for self-aware adaptive systems and proposes
               enabling technologies to address these three challenges. We
               describe a framework called Application Heartbeats that provides
               a general, standardized way for applications to monitor their
               performance and make that information available to external
               observers. Then, through a study of a self-optimizing
               synchronization library called Smartlocks, we demonstrate a
               powerful technique that systems can use to determine which
               optimization actions to take. We show that Heartbeats can be
               applied naturally in the context of reinforcement learning
               optimization strategies as a reward signal and that, using such
               a strategy, Smartlocks are able to significantly improve
               performance of applications on an important emerging class of
               multicore systems called asymmetric multicores.",

              for fluents. A robot with self-aware system has the possibility
              of dealing with complex novel situations more effectively than a
              robot without self-awareness (see e.g. [1, 2]). In [1], the
              authors considered robot self-awareness from the point of view of
              temporal relation based data mining. Temporal patterns can be
              expressed using fluents (see e.g. [1, 3]). A fluent is a
              proposition with temporal extent. For example, `` drinking-coffee
              '' can be defined as a fluent that is true whenever I am drinking
              coffee. This fluent can be represented as a binary time series x,
              where x[t] is 1 if and only if I am drinking coffee at time t.

              of fluents. To build a system of self-awareness the robot needs a
              system of automatic selection of fluents and prediction of values

              long-lasting debate in the machine learning community over
              Occam's razor, Domingos (Data Min. Knowl. Discov. 3:409--425,

              complexity is only a confounding factor usually correlated with
              the number of mod-els from which the learner selects. It is thus
              hypothesized that the risk of overfitting (poor generalization)

              complexity of the selected model. We test this hypothesis on 30

               formed by traditional sensor fusion and state estimation
               algorithms. In cooperative tasks with non-expert humans, a robot
               needs to effectively communicate its belief so that the gathered

              parameters has no obvious relation to our prior knowledge, and
              integration over the posterior is computationally very demanding.
              I address the problem by deening classes of prior distributions

  abstract  = "Bayesian optimization is an effective methodology for the global
               optimization of functions with expensive evaluations. It relies
               on querying a distribution over functions defined by a
               relatively cheap surrogate model. An accurate model for this
               distribution over functions is critical to the effectiveness of
               the approach, and is typically fit using Gaussian processes
               (GPs). However, since GPs scale cubically with the number of
               observations, it has been challenging to handle objectives whose
               optimization requires many evaluations, and as such, massively
               parallelizing the optimization. In this work, we explore the use
               of neural networks as an alternative to GPs to model
               distributions over functions. We show that performing adaptive
               basis function regression with a neural network as the
               parametric form performs competitively with state-of-the-art
               GP-based approaches, but scales linearly with the number of data
               rather than cubically. This allows us to achieve a previously
               intractable degree of parallelism, which we apply to large scale
               hyperparameter optimization, rapidly finding competitive models
               on benchmark object recognition tasks using convolutional
               networks, and image caption generation using neural language

  abstract  = "When learning models from data, the interpretability of the
               resulting model is often mandatory. For example, safety-related
               applications for automation and control require that the
               correctness of the model must be ensured not only for the
               available data but for all possible input combinations. Thus,
               understanding what the model has learned and in particular how
               it will extrapolate to unseen data is a crucial concern. The
               paper discusses suitable learning methods for classification and
               regression. For classification problems, we review an approach
               based on an ensemble of nonlinear low-dimensional submodels,
               where each submodel is simple enough to be completely verified
               by domain experts. For regression problems, we review related
               approaches that try to achieve interpretability by using
               low-dimensional submodels (for instance, MARS and tree-growing
               methods). We compare them with symbolic regression, which is a
               different approach based on genetic algorithms. Finally, a novel
               approach is proposed for combining a symbolic regression model,
               which is shown to be easily interpretable, with a Gaussian
               Process. The combined model has an improved accuracy and
               provides error bounds in the sense that the deviation from the
               verified symbolic model is always kept below a defined limit.",

  abstract = "We present a theoretical analysis for prediction algorithms based
              on association rules. As part of this analysis, we introduce a
              problem for which rules are particularly natural, called ``
              sequential event prediction. '' In sequential event prediction,
              events in a sequence are revealed one by one, and the goal is to
              determine which event will next be revealed. The training set is
              a collection of past sequences of events. An example application
              is to predict which item will next be placed into a customer's
              online shopping cart, given his/her past purchases. In the
              context of this problem, algorithms based on association rules
              have distinct advantages over classical statistical and machine
              learning methods: they look at correlations based on subsets of
              co-occurring past events (items a and b imply item c), they can
              be applied to the sequential event prediction problem in a
              natural way, they can potentially handle the `` cold start ''
              problem where the training set is small, and they yield
              interpretable predictions. In this work, we present two
              algorithms that incorporate association rules. These algorithms
              can be used both for sequential event prediction and for
              supervised classification, and they are simple enough that they
              can possibly be understood by users, customers, patients,
              managers, etc. We provide generalization guarantees on these
              algorithms based on algorithmic stability analysis from

              strict minimum support threshold often used in association rule
              mining, and introduce an `` adjusted confidence '' measure that
              provides a weaker minimum support condition that has advantages
              over the strict minimum support. The paper brings together ideas

              predictive models of recidivism that are sufficiently accurate,
              transparent and interpretable to use for decision making. This
              question is complicated as these models are used to support
              different decisions, from sentencing, to determining release on
              probation to allocating preventative social services. Each case
              might have an objective other than classification accuracy, such
              as a desired true positive rate TPR or false positive rate FPR.
              Each (TPR, FPR) pair is a point on the receiver operator
              characteristic (ROC) curve. We use popular machine learning
              methods to create models along the full ROC curve on a wide range
              of recidivism prediction problems. We show that many methods
              (support vector machines, stochastic gradient boosting and ridge
              regression) produce equally accurate models along the full ROC
              curve. However, methods that are designed for interpretability
              (classification and regression trees and C5.0) cannot be tuned to
              produce models that are accurate and/or interpretable. To handle
              this shortcoming, we use a recent method called supersparse
              linear integer models to produce accurate, transparent and
              interpretable scoring systems along the full ROC curve. These
              scoring systems can be used for decision making for many
              different use cases, since they are just as accurate as the most

               the distribution that generate the examples changes over time.
               We present a method for detection of changes in the probability
               distribution of examples. The idea behind the drift detection
               method is to control the online error-rate of the algorithm. The
               training examples are presented in sequence. When a new training
               example is available, it is classified using the actual model.
               Statistical theory guarantees that while the distribution is
               stationary, the error will decrease. When the distribution
               changes, the error will increase. The method controls the trace
               of the online error of the algorithm. For the actual context we
               define a warning level, and a drift level. A new context is
               declared, if in a sequence of examples, the error increases
               reaching the warning level at example k w , and the drift level
               at example k d . This is an indication of a change in the
               distribution of the examples. The algorithm learns a new model
               using only the examples since k w . The method was tested with a
               set of eight artificial datasets and a real world dataset. We
               used three learning algorithms: a perceptron, a neural network
               and a decision tree. The experimental results show a good
               performance detecting drift and with learning the new concept.

               case of dataset shift, occurs when only the input distribution
               changes. Dataset shift is present in most practical
               applications, for reasons ranging from the bias introduced by
               experimental design to the irreproducibility of the testing
               conditions at training time. (An example is -email spam
               filtering, which may fail to recognize spam that differs in form
               from the spam the automatic filter has been built on.) Despite

               anyone who wants to understand the connectionist

               intelligence might emerge from the activity of networks of
               neuronlike entities. Minsky and Papert's book was the first

               the exact limitations of a class of computing machines that
               could seriously be considered as models of the brain. Now the

               understanding of how ``objects'' or ``agents'' with
               individuality can emerge in a network. Progress in this area

              uncertainty due to input data uncertainty is considered. Two
              types of uncertainty models for input variables and/or their
              distribution parameters are addressed: 1) uncertainty modeled as
              family of distributions, and 2) uncertainty modeled as interval
              data. A Bayesian approach is adopted to update the uncertainty
              models, where the likelihood functions are constructed using
              limited experimental data. Global sensitivity analysis, which
              previously only considered aleatory inputs in the context of
              probabilistic representation, is extended in this paper to
              quantify the contributions of both aleatory and epistemic
              uncertainty sources for multioutput problems using an auxiliary

              are fixed a priori and the hyperparameters, such as the
              bandwidth, are predefined, often through expert judgment. As an
              alternative to these methods, a nonparametric model using
              Gaussian processes was recently proposed. Using Gaussian
              processes, it is possible to maintain constant coverage over the
              operating domain by adaptively selecting new kernel locations as
              well as adapt hyperparameters in an online setting to improve
              model prediction. In this work, the first extensive experimental
              flight results are presented using Gaussian process/model
              reference adaptive control. Experimental results show that
              Gaussian process/model reference adaptive control outperforms

              adaptive element as being known exactly, and they do not
              incorporate certainty of the prior model into the control policy.
              In this paper, the notion of a Bayesian scaling factor is
              introduced that scales the adaptive element in order to
              incorporate the uncertainty of the prior model and current model

               The goal of the rating system is to elucidate black-box models
               and bring interpretability to any predictive model no matter how
               complex. As part of the system, we learn lower dimensional
               interpretable versions of potentially com-plex models, attempt
               to learn a causal structure of the un-derlying data, and propose
               an augumentation to the un-derlying black-box algorithm as a way
               of reducing bias in predictive modeling. This work is still

               algorithm combines principal components analysis of the data set
               with orthogonalization with respect to sensitive attribute(s).
               The orthogonalization algorithm presented is motivated by
               appli-cations where there is a need to drastically 'sanitize' a

                   optical character recognition system by first training a
                   character segmenter, an isolated character recognizer, and a
                   language model, using appropriate labeled training sets.
                   Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the
                   resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic operation in
                   a space of models. The resulting model answers a new
                   question, that is, converting the image of a text page into
                   a computer readable text. This observation suggests a
                   conceptual continuity between algebraically rich inference
                   systems, such as logical or probabilistic inference, and
                   simple manipulations, such as the mere concatenation of
                   trainable learning systems. Therefore, instead of trying to
                   bridge the gap between machine learning systems and
                   sophisticated ``all-purpose'' inference mechanisms, we can
                   instead algebraically enrich the set of manipulations
                   applicable to training systems, and build reasoning
                   capabilities from the ground up.",

               is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is
               fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction,
               or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such

                   interpretable. And yet the task of interpretation appears
                   underspecified. Papers provide diverse and sometimes

                   deeper understanding of model behavior, and in particular
                   how different features influence the model prediction. This
                   is important when interpreting the behavior of complex
                   models, or asserting that certain problematic attributes
                   (like race or gender) are not unduly influencing decisions.
                   In this paper, we present a technique for auditing black-box
                   models, which lets us study the extent to which existing
                   models take advantage of particular features in the dataset,
                   without knowing how the models work. Our work focuses on the
                   problem of indirect influence: how some features might
                   indirectly influence outcomes via other, related features.
                   As a result, we can find attribute influences even in cases
                   where, upon further direct examination of the model, the

                   only accessible via an API, and contrasts our work with

                   explain the factors influencing intuition and the accuracy
                   of the results from this process. In this paper, we present
                   a simple series based model for implementation of human-like
                   intuition using the principles of connectivity and unknown
                   entities. By using Poker hand datasets and Car evaluation
                   datasets, we compare the performance of some well-known
                   models with our intuition model. The aim of the experiment
                   was to predict the maximum accurate answers using intuition
                   based models. We found that the presence of unknown
                   entities, diversion from the current problem scenario, and
                   identifying weakness without the normal logic based
                   execution, greatly affects the reliability of the answers.
                   Generally, the intuition based models cannot be a substitute
                   for the logic based mechanisms in handling such problems.
                   The intuition can only act as a support for an ongoing logic
                   based model that processes all the steps in a sequential
                   manner. However, when time and computational cost are very
                   strict constraints, this intuition based model becomes
                   extremely important and useful, because it can give a
                   reasonably good performance. Factors affecting intuition are
                   analyzed and interpreted through our model.",

              interest in building systems that learn and think like people.
              Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained
              end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and
              board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats
              humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and
              performance achievements, these systems differ from human
              intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive
              science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking
              machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in
              both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we
              argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the
              world that support explanation and understanding, rather than
              merely solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning
              in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and
              enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness
              compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and

                   techniques that first compute a similarity structure of the
                   data points and then project them into a low-dimensional
                   space with the structure preserved. These two steps suffer
                   from considerable computational costs, preventing the
                   state-of-the-art methods such as the t-SNE from scaling to
                   large-scale and high-dimensional data (e.g., millions of
                   data points and hundreds of dimensions). We propose the
                   LargeVis, a technique that first constructs an accurately
                   approximated K-nearest neighbor graph from the data and then
                   layouts the graph in the low-dimensional space. Comparing to
                   t-SNE, LargeVis significantly reduces the computational cost
                   of the graph construction step and employs a principled
                   probabilistic model for the visualization step, the
                   objective of which can be effectively optimized through
                   asynchronous stochastic gradient descent with a linear time
                   complexity. The whole procedure thus easily scales to
                   millions of high-dimensional data points. Experimental
                   results on real-world data sets demonstrate that the
                   LargeVis outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both
                   efficiency and effectiveness. The hyper-parameters of
                   LargeVis are also much more stable over different data sets.",

              found human operators often underutilize (disuse) and overly rely
              on (misuse) automated aids (Parasuraman and Riley, 1997). Three
              studies were performed with Cameron University students to
              explore the relationship among automation reliability, trust, and
              reliance. With the assistance of an automated decision aid,
              participants viewed slides of Fort Sill terrain and indicated the

  abstract = "We examine ultraintelligent reinforcement learning agents.
              Reinforcement learning can only be used in the real world to
              define agents whose goal is to maximize expected rewards, and
              since this goal does not match with human goals, AGIs based on
              reinforcement learning will often work at crosspurposes to us. We
              define value learners, agents that can be designed to learn and
              maximize any initially unknown utility function so long as we
              provide them with an idea of what constitutes evidence about that
              utility function. 1 Agents and Implementations Traditional agents
              [2, 3] interact with their environments cyclically: in cycle k,
              an agent acts with action y k , then perceives observation x k .
              The interaction history of an agent with lifespan m is a string y
              1 x 1 y 2 x 2 ...y m x m , also written yx 1:m or yx $\leq$m .
              Beyond these interactions, a traditional agent is isolated from
              its environment, so an agent can be formalized as an agent
              function from an interaction history yx <k to an action y k .
              Since we are concerned not with agents in the abstract, but with
              very powerful agents in the real world, we introduce the concept
              of an agent implementation. An agent implementation is a physical
              structure that, in the absence of interference from its
              environment, implements an agent function. In cycle k, an
              unaltered agent implementation executes its agent function on its
              recalled interaction history yx <k , sends the resulting y k into
              the environment as output, then receives and records an
              observation x k . An agent implementation's behavior is only
              guaranteed to match its implemented function so long as effects
              from the environment do not destroy the agent or alter its
              functionality. In keeping with this realism, an agent
              implementation's environment is considered to be the real world
              in which we live. We may engineer some parts of the world to meet
              our specifications, but (breaking with some traditional agent
              formulations) we do not consider the environment to be completely
              under our control, to be defined as we wish. Why would one want
              to study agent implementations? For narrowlyintelligent agents,
              the distinction between traditional agents and agent
              implementations may not be worth making. For ultraintelligent
              agents, the distinction is quite important: agent implementations
              offer us better predictions about how powerful agents will affect
              their environments and their own machinery, and are the basis for
              understanding realworld agents that model, defend, maintain, and
              improve themselves.",

              arguing for two theses. The first, the orthogonality thesis,
              holds (with some caveats) that intelligence and final goals
              (purposes) are orthogonal axes along which possible artificial
              intellects can freely vary---more or less any level of
              intelligence could be combined with more or less any final goal.
              The second, the instrumental convergence thesis, holds that as
              long as they possess a sufficient level of intelligence, agents
              having any of a wide range of final goals will pursue similar
              intermediary goals because they have instrumental reasons to do
              so. In combination, the two theses help us understand the
              possible range of behavior of superintelligent agents, and they
              point to some potential dangers in building such an agent.",

               Specifically, we consider a wide range of feature selection

              they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by
              decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future

              by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true

  abstract      = "The vast majority of theoretical results in machine learning
                   and statistics assume that the available training data is a
                   reasonably reliable reflection of the phenomena to be
                   learned or estimated. Similarly, the majority of machine
                   learning and statistical techniques used in practice are
                   brittle to the presence of large amounts of biased or
                   malicious data. In this work we consider two frameworks in
                   which to study estimation, learning, and optimization in the
                   presence of significant fractions of arbitrary data. The
                   first framework, list-decodable learning, asks whether it is
                   possible to return a list of answers, with the guarantee
                   that at least one of them is accurate. For example, given a
                   dataset of $n$ points for which an unknown subset of $\alpha
                   n$ points are drawn from a distribution of interest, and no
                   assumptions are made about the remaining $(1-\alpha)n$
                   points, is it possible to return a list of
                   $\operatorname\{poly\}(1/\alpha)$ answers, one of which is
                   correct? The second framework, which we term the
                   semi-verified learning model, considers the extent to which
                   a small dataset of trusted data (drawn from the distribution
                   in question) can be leveraged to enable the accurate
                   extraction of information from a much larger but untrusted
                   dataset (of which only an $\alpha$-fraction is drawn from
                   the distribution). We show strong positive results in both
                   settings, and provide an algorithm for robust learning in a
                   very general stochastic optimization setting. This general
                   result has immediate implications for robust estimation in a
                   number of settings, including for robustly estimating the
                   mean of distributions with bounded second moments, robustly
                   learning mixtures of such distributions, and robustly
                   finding planted partitions in random graphs in which
                   significant portions of the graph have been perturbed by an

               decision-makers is that they should adapt well to changes in
               unexpected situations. This paper addresses the situation in
               which an AI for aerial dog fighting, with tunable parameters
               that govern its behavior, must optimize behavior with respect to
               an objective function that is evaluated and learned through
               simulations. Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian Process
               surrogate is used as the method for investigating the objective
               function. One key benefit is that during optimization, the
               Gaussian Process learns a global estimate of the true objective
               function, with predicted outcomes and a statistical measure of
               confidence in areas that haven't been investigated yet. Having a
               model of the objective function is important for being able to
               understand possible outcomes in the decision space, for example
               this is crucial for training and providing feedback to human
               pilots. However, standard Bayesian optimization does not perform
               consistently or provide an accurate Gaussian Process surrogate
               function for highly volatile objective functions. We treat these
               problems by introducing a novel sampling technique called Hybrid
               Repeat/Multi-point Sampling. This technique gives the AI ability
               to learn optimum behaviors in a highly uncertain environment.
               More importantly, it not only improves the reliability of the
               optimization, but also creates a better model of the entire
               objective surface. With this improved model the agent is
               equipped to more accurately/efficiently predict performance in

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In many randomized and non-randomized comparative
               trials, researchers measure a continuous endpoint repeatedly in
               order to decrease intra-patient variability and thus increase
               statistical power. There has been little guidance in the
               literature as to selecting the optimal number of repeated
               measures. METHODS: The degree to which adding a further measure
               increases statistical power can be derived from simple formulae.
               This ``marginal benefit'' can be used to inform the optimal
               number of repeat assessments. RESULTS: Although repeating
               assessments can have dramatic effects on power, marginal benefit
               of an additional measure rapidly decreases as the number of
               measures rises. There is little value in increasing the number
               of either baseline or post-treatment assessments beyond four, or
               seven where baseline assessments are taken. An exception is when
               correlations between measures are low, for instance, episodic
               conditions such as headache. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method
               offers a rational basis for determining the number of repeat

  title    = "Genetic Fuzzy based Artificial Intelligence for Unmanned Combat
              Aerial Vehicle Control in Simulated Air Combat Missions",
  author   = "Ernest, Nicholas and Carroll, David",
  abstract = "Volume 6 • Issue 1 • 1000144 J Def Manag ISSN: 2167-0374 JDFM, an
              open access journal While this automates the process, the
              computational cost of the genetic algorithm for searching over a
              practically infinite solution space causes the traditional
              genetic fuzzy system to be infeasible in more complex problems.
              Methodologies have been developed to help mitigate this, but one
              method in particular is capable of applying fuzzy control to
              problems of this scope. The Genetic Fuzzy Tree (GFT) has shown an
              incredible ability to obtain unparalleled levels of performance
              in very large and complex problems that contain all of the
              difficulties that alternative intelligent systems have issues
              coping with. This new subtype of genetic fuzzy system was
              recently developed during Dr. Ernest's graduate studies, under
              the guidance of Dr.'s Cohen and Schumacher and supported by the
              Dayton Area Graduate Studies Institute. The aim of this initial
              work was to control a flight of ground strike UCAVs in a
              low-fidelity simulation environment [5,6]. The success of this
              study led to Psibernetix Inc. partnering with the US air force
              research laboratory (AFRL) to apply the GFT methodology to a much
              more complex problem. Just as UAVs represented a revolutionary
              capability for the USAF in the mid-1990s, Manned-Unmanned
              Autonomous Teaming in an air combat environment will certainly
              represent a revolutionary leap in capability of airpower in the
              near future. Air combat, as it is performed by human pilots today
              is a highly dynamic application of aerospace physics, skill, art,
              and intuition to maneuver a fighter aircraft and missile against
              an adversary moving at high speeds in three dimensions. Today's
              fighters close on each other at speeds in excess of 1,500 MPH
              while flying at altitudes above 40,000 feet. The selection and
              application of air-to-air tactics requires assessing a tactical
              advantage or disadvantage and reacting appropriately in
              microseconds. The cost of mistakes is high.",
