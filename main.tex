\begin{abstract}
    Those who use advanced autonomous systems need to be able to understand their competencies and limitations in order to trust and use them appropriately. It is possible for these systems to influence a user's trust via `algorithmic assurances'. Designing advanced autonomous systems with the capacity of assessing their own capabilities is one approach to creating an algorithmic assurance. The idea of `self-confidence' of autonomous systems is introduced; one component of self-confidence, called `solver-quality' is discussed in the context of Markov decision processes for autonomous systems. Markov decision processes underlie much of the theory of reinforcement learning, and are commonly used for planning and decision making under uncertainty in robotics and autonomous systems. The solver-quality metric is formally defined, and derived; several computational trials indicate that the metric exhibits the desired properties. Discussion of results, and avenues for future investigation are included. \nisar{compress/remove the first few sentences about trust/autonomous systems and get to MDPs/ML/uncertain decision making connection a bit faster...trust motivation doesn't need to be spelled out so much in the abstract since we are preaching to the choir, but should be articulated in the intro/background as motivation...fix this last}
